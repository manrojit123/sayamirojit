                            safety DAS network for the Hawaii Convention Center (HCC). The long term, 10-year agreement will bring improved cellular coverage and capacity to the 1.1 million square foot facility and help HCC accommodate connectivity
                            demands of the 5G era. </p>
                        <p> “Boingo is pleased to add HCC to our growing DAS portfolio of premier convention centers, airports, stadiums and transportation hubs,” said Doug Lodder, senior vice president, general manager of carrier services at Boingo. “Our
                            5G-ready, neutral host approach will allow for multiple carriers to access the DAS network, keeping more visitors and staff connected to enhance the guest experience.” </p>
                        <p> After extensive evaluation, the Hawaii Tourism Authority chose Boingo for its technical and operational expertise. Boingo is the largest provider of indoor DAS networks in the U.S. The company’s contract with HCC adds to its DAS
                            and Wi-Fi footprint in Hawaii, which covers five major airports, including Daniel K. Inouye International (HNL) and Kahului Airport (OGG), three military bases and a multifamily community. </p>
                        <p> Located in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, HCC can accommodate up to 13,000 event attendees. There are 47 meeting rooms, a 200,000 square foot exhibit hall, two-tiered seating theaters, a 35,000 square foot ballroom and 2.5-acre
                            landscaped rooftop terrace. Boingo’s DAS network will help ensure seamless consumer connectivity and first responder communications for the entire event space. </p>

                            <p>The National Football League team the Carolina Panthers used the 2015 offseason to improve the wireless fan experience its Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
                            <p>At that time, the Panthers were looking for a technical partner to update the stadium’s wireless network infrastructure and replace the existing carrier-led distributed antenna system (DAS).</p>
                            <p>The Panthers finally decided to team up with the consulting firm Beam Wireless to provide technical services and identify the best DAS vendor for the project. After considering the many available options, the Panthers and Beam
                                Wireless chose CommScope’s ION-U solution.</p>
                            <p>The completely new, venue-led neutral host DAS was designed and deployed in a three-month period and supports four major wireless carriers.</p>
                            <p>“ION-U is a robust, flexible solution that permits all 75,000 fans at the stadium to use their mobile devices any way they want. App usage, check-ins, shares and chats peak at football games, concerts and other events hosted
                                by the stadium. It supports multiple operators, frequency bands and air interface technologies in one unified, low- and high-power system,” CommScope said. “Network engineers can adjust power levels on ION-U all the way
                                down to individual frequency bands for better optimization.”</p>
                            <p>As part of the connectivity project, CommScope supplied the active ION-U components as well as the cables, antennas and low passive intermodulation (PIM) devices. Rack mount fiber chassis, adapter plates, fiber optic connectors,
                                splitter modules and fiber patch cords also played into the design and deployment of an optical local area network (LAN) solution for a gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON) in the stadium suites and high-performance
                                structured cabling to help support the DAS.</p>
                            <p>Qypsys, a nationwide system integrator specializing in passive optical LAN, led the GPON/Optical LAN solutions installation.</p>
                            <p>The optical LAN fiber network infrastructure helps the Panthers support stadium operations and deliver an integrated, engaging fan experience, according to CommScope, with integrated infrastructure enabling applications such
                                as high-bandwidth data, voice, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Wi-Fi services; high-definition TV and hospitality services for more than 150 executive suites; and broadband video.</p>
                            <p>“Providing an exceptional experience for our fans—on the field and in the stands—is a top priority for the entire Panthers organization,” said James Hammond, director of information technology for the Carolina Panthers. “We
                                decided to acquire the DAS ourselves in order to take greater control of the wireless fan experience, speed the deployment process, and make future upgrades and optimization easier for network operators.”</p>

                            <p>The company has yet to announce second-quarter earnings, but it published a “milestone” press release in which&nbsp;it said it deployed 10 new DAS networks in the second quarter in partnership with Tier 1 carriers. The deployments
                                were at high traffic venues throughout the U.S., boosting the company’s total live DAS venues to 69.</p>
                            <p>“Our strong DAS momentum continues with significant traction in venue deployments and strategic partnerships with carriers to densify networks and enhance cellular coverage,” Finley said in a <a href="https://investors.boingo.com/file/Index?KeyFile=398750260" rel="nofollow">press release</a>. “This new record fuels growth for our neutral host DAS portfolio, a key driver for Boingo’s business, and helps our venue partners solve skyrocketing connectivity demands.”</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>It's worth noting that in the first quarter, Boingo deployed just one DAS venue. But taken with the second quarter, it&nbsp;launched a total of 11 new DAS networks at large venues that include three major airports, seven amphitheaters
                            and a commercial real estate property. The company didn’t identify the airports or other properties specifically.</p>
                        <p>Boingo for some time now has noted its backlog on DAS orders. Finley said during the first-quarter earnings call that on average a DAS network takes 18 to 24 months from when the company wins a contract to actually getting a network
                            up and running live with an anchor tenant.</p>
                        <p>“The DAS opportunity for Boingo remains incredibly robust. We currently have 134 DAS venues under contract, with 65 to be deployed, providing a lot of runway ahead of us,” Finley said in a statement provided to FierceWirelessTech,
                            when asked for an update on the current situation. “We are well positioned to take advantage of the explosive mobile data growth.”</p>
                        <p>The company didn’t name names in its press release, but confirmed the DAS deployments were in partnership with domestic Tier 1 wireless carriers, which include AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.</p>
                        <p>Finley earlier this year replaced long-time Boingo CEO Dave Hagan, who announced plans to retire after 17 years with the company. Finley previously had been a Boingo board member, and worked in many positions at U.S. carriers before
                            taking a role as head of Qualcomm in North America and Australia.</p>
                        <p>In an interview with Fierce last month, he indicated that Boingo’s strategy wasn’t changing with his new role. He might bring a different management style to the position, but the company’s priorities would remain largely the same.</p>
                        <p>According to Boingo, its neutral host DAS networks are designed to provide a high-performance wireless experience to all venue customers and staff, regardless of which carrier they use. The networks are built to meet a venue’s
                            current connectivity demands and to scale to support content consumption for the 5G era.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Boingo’s full suite of wireless solutions includes&nbsp;not only DAS but&nbsp;5G, millimeter wave, LTE, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi offload via Passpoint, IoT and Citizens Broadband Radio Services (CBRS).</p>

                            </div>There will be a change in the air at Folsom Field this fall, and not just from the team that new head coach Mel Tucker will lead onto the gridiron. For the first time, the mile-high atmosphere inside the University of Colorado’s
                            historic venue will be filled with fan-facing Wi-Fi and cellular signals, thanks to new networks being installed this offseason by third-party host Neutral Connect Networks (NCN).
                            <p></p>
                            <p>In a deal that will also bring Wi-Fi and a cellular DAS to the school’s basketball arena, NCN will use Cisco gear for the Wi-Fi network and JMA Wireless gear for the cellular networks. A centrally located head-end will serve
                                both venues via fiber connections, some run through existing tunnels from the campus’ old steam-heating infrastructure.</p>
                            <p>Due to be live (<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Now CU says the networks will not be operational until later this fall) <del datetime="2019-09-06T18:28:26+00:00">before the 2019 football season begins on Sept. 7 when CU hosts Nebraska</del>,
                                later this fall, the Wi-Fi network will use 550 APs in a mostly under-seat deployment at Folsom Field, where there are no overhangs over any of the seating areas. DAS deployment in Colorado’s historic football stadium —
                                which first hosted games in 1924 — will use antennas pointing down from the stadium’s top edges, with some new flagpoles scheduled to help provide antenna-mounting locations.</p>
                            <p>While its incredibly picturesque location at the edge of the Rocky Mountains has historically made Folsom Field a fan-favorite place to visit (at least for photos), the lack of any comprehensive wireless coverage of any sort
                                has produced some grumbling from Buffs fans in recent years. According to Matt Biggers, CU’s chief marketing officer and associate athletic director for external affairs, wireless coverage inside the sports venues has been
                                a topic of internal research for more than 6 years.</p>
                            <p>“It was all about finding a partner and a financial model that works for us,” said Biggers. “It finally got to a point where it made sense to pull the trigger.”</p>

                            </div>The model brought to CU is a classic neutral-host operation, where a provider like NCN (which bought the former sports-stadium practice from 5 Bars) will build a school’s Wi-Fi and DAS networks under a revenue-sharing deal
                            with the school where the carriers help some with upfront payments and then provide payments over a long-term lease to operate on the DAS.
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The neutral-host option is one good way for schools or teams with smaller budgets or lightly used facilities to bring connectivity to arenas. CU’s Folsom Field, for example, doesn’t see much use other than the six home games
                                per football season. This year, the stadium will see big crowds beyond football only at a few events, including the Memorial Day Bolder Boulder 10K footrace (which ends inside the stadium), a Fourth of July fireworks celebration,
                                and a couple of July concerts featuring the Dead &amp; Company tour.</p>
                            <p>According to James Smith, vice president of carrier services for NCN, AT&amp;T will be the anchor tenant on the DAS, and will be first to be operational. Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile, Smith said, are still negotiating long-term
                                agreements but are expected to be on the DAS by 2020.</p>
                            <p>NCN [then under its old name of 5 Bars] negotiated a similar neutral-host deal with CU’s neighbor to the north, Colorado State University, for <a href="https://www.mobilesportsreport.com/2017/10/new-colorado-state-stadium-has-winning-wi-fi-network/">CSU’s new football stadium</a> which opened in 2017. Now known as Canvas Stadium, the 41,000-seat venue had 419 total Wi-Fi access points when it opened, with approximately 250 of those used in the bowl seating area. Like CSU’s deployment, the Wi-Fi
                                network at Folsom Field will use primarily under-seat AP deployments, mainly because the stadium’s horseshoe layout has no overhangs.</p>

                            </div>According to NCN’s Smith, the current plan sees a deployment of 550 APs in Folsom Field, with another 70 APs in the basketball arena, the CU Events Center. Both venues’ networks will be served by a central head-end room located
                            in an old telephone PBX space near the center of campus. Fiber links will run from there to both Folsom Field and the Events Center.
                            <p></p>
                            <p>At Folsom, the NCN team will have a long list of deployment challenges, mainly having to navigate the construction particulars of a stadium that has been gradually expanded and added onto over the years. </p>
                            <p>“Sometimes it’s hard to know what’s behind a brick,” said NCN director of program management Bryan Courtney, speaking of existing infrastructure that has been around for decades. Smith said the Folsom Field DAS will make use
                                of overhead antennas, including some that will require new flagpole-type structures that will need to match Folsom Field’s architectural heritage.</p>
                            <h2>Basketball arena is all top-down</h2>
                            <p>At the 11,064-seat CU Events Center, formerly known as the Coors Events Center, deployment of both Wi-Fi and DAS will be somewhat easier, as all the gear servicing the seating area will be suspended from the catwalks. With
                                the main concourse at stadium entry level and all the seats in a single rectangular bowl flowing down from there, the ceiling is close enough for good top-down coverage for both Wi-Fi and celluar, NCN’s Smith said.</p>

                            </div>Though deployment of both networks in the Events Center is currently underway, neither will be active until after the current college basketball season is completed. However, the Events Center stays somewhat more busy than
                            the football stadium, with events like local high school graduations and other special events (like a Republican Party debate in 2015) making use of the space. Both networks should be fully up and running by the next basketball
                            season, according to NCN.
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Unlike some other universities that are aggressively pursuing digital fan-connection strategies, CU’s Biggers said the school will start slowly with its fan-facing networks, making sure the experience is a solid one before
                                trying too hard.</p>
                            <p>“We’re pretty conservative, and this is a complicated project and we want to make sure we get it right,” said Biggers. Though Biggers said CU fans haven’t been extremely vocal about connectivity issues inside the sports venues,
                                he does admit to hearing about “some frustration” about signals in some areas of the stadium (which until now has only been served by a couple of dedicated macro antennas from the outside). </p>
                            <p>“There’s definitely a hunger [for wireless service],” Biggers said.</p>
                            <p>On the business side, Biggers said CU will also be taking more time to evaluate any additions to its game-day digital operations. Though CU recently introduced a mobile-only “buzzer beater” basketball ticket package that offered
                                discounted passes that would deliver an assigned seat to a device 24 hours before game time, Biggers said that for football, a longtime paper-ticket tradition for season ticket holders would likely stay in place.</p>
                            <p>Colorado will also “re-evaluate” its game-day mobile application strategy, Biggers said, with the new networks in mind. “But the real game-changer for us is data collection,” he said. “We’re most excited about having data to
                                better serve the fans.”</p>

                        <p>The CBRS Direct platform will provide a highly automated and user-friendly system for operators, investors and others that hold PAL spectrum rights to monetize the entirety or unused portions of their PALs in a streamlined manner. Organizations seeking licensed CBRS spectrum rights will also be able to quickly find and purchase or rent them via the platform. "The system will be quite robust," stated <span class="xn-person">Andreas Bitzarakis</span>, Director of Broadband at Select Spectrum, "functionality will include support for partitioning and disaggregation of licenses." Partitioning of licenses involves the division of licenses along geographic lines for a portion of a license area, while disaggregation refers to spectrally segmenting a license by frequency for less than the full bandwidth. "These features of CBRS Direct will provide potential users with a high degree of flexibility," elaborated <span class="xn-person">Zachary Thompson</span>, Manager, Sales &amp; Analytics at Select Spectrum, "partitioning, for example, will allow for small scale transactions, perhaps down to the Census Tract level or lower, conforming to the desired coverage area of an operator or user."</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>In Auction 105, the FCC auctioned licenses off on a county-size basis, with seven licenses to a county. However, many proponents of the band had petitioned the FCC to incorporate Census Tract sized licenses instead. CBRS Direct will provide these users with access to spectrum on a sub-county basis, and PAL rights holders the ability to gain a return on portions of their license areas that may be underutilized – an appealing proposition for both prospective buyers and sellers of PAL spectrum. The platform will also support transactions for full-county areas, as well as leasing and sub-leasing.</p>
                        <p>CBRS Direct will interface directly with one or more of the FCC's designated Spectrum Access System "SAS" databases while still operating independently of any specific SAS operator. The platform is expected to launch in early 2021, after licenses are granted by the FCC to the Auction 105 winners.</p>

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Verizon first to use Samsung’s new indoor 5G mmWave small cell</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 24, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Bevin Fletcher </span>
                    <div property="schema:articleBody">
                        <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Samsung today unveiled its indoor 5G millimeter wave small cell that Verizon plans to deploy later this year.</p>
                        <p>Last week Verizon said <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/verizon-to-deploy-indoor-5g-mmwave-sites-corning-samsung">lab trials</a> were underway with Samsung to test the product, along with field tests of an in-building
                            5G cell site from Corning.</p>
                        <p>The first iteration of Samsung’s Link Cell supports 28 GHz and can combine four 100 MHz channels of spectrum for gigabit speeds. At 3.8 liters in volume, the South Korean electronics giant says the compact small cell is one of
                            the smallest in the industry, combining the baseband, radio, and antenna elements. It’s also lightweight at 2.8 kilograms (or just over 6 pounds). &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>According to Samsung, it’s one of the first commercially available indoor mmWave small cells and deployments only need one technician to do the job, with a single Ethernet cable to provide backhaul for each unit. It can be positioned
                            like a Wi-Fi access point, affixed to walls or ceilings in places like manufacturing facilities, corporate offices and public venues.</p>
                        <p>Verizon’s currently focused on using high-capacity 28 GHz millimeter wave for 5G, which has limited signal reach and poor penetration. In-building solutions are key in order to link the carrier’s outdoor 5G services with indoor
                            connectivity, and support potential future private enterprise 5G networks.</p>
                        <p>“Verizon continues to rapidly advance our 5G deployment, and the addition of indoor cell sites will extend the availability of the fastest 5G service in the U.S. This is a key step in providing industry-changing, scalable, latency-sensitive,
                            robust 5G solutions for enterprises,” said Adam Koeppe, senior vice president of Technology Planning and Development at Verizon, in a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-brings-5g-indoors-with-new-commercial-5g-mmwave-small-cell-for-in-building-use" rel="nofollow">statement</a>.</p>
                        <p>Samsung’s been working with Verizon on millimeter wave for some time and was one of its 5G suppliers early on, alongside Ericsson and Nokia. The carrier was the <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/verizon-first-to-deploy-samsung-s-new-5g-nr-access-unit">first to deploy</a> Samsung’s 5G NR integrated mmWave access unit, which helped hit <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/verizon-works-samsung-qualcomm-to-achieve-4-2-gbps-its-5g-network">4.2 Gbps speeds</a> during a live network demo in
                            February. This month Verizon handed Samsung a multi-year 5G <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/samsung-scores-6b-network-deal-verizon">network deal</a> worth $6.65 billion.</p>

                        <p>As for the new Link Cell unit, Samsung said it adjusts to optimize RF performance, so users can transition from the outdoor macro 5G network to in-building connectivity without interruption, or use it for specific mobile applications
                            on-site. It uses Qualcomm’s 5G RAN Modem-RF technology and Durga Malladi, SVP and general manager 4G/5G said in a statement that the infrastructure “addresses the challenging power and size requirements for enterprise deployments.”</p>
                        <p>While Samsung’s network business is smaller than those of telecom equipment giants Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei, it’s been a challenger and supported commercial 5G launches in markets like the U.S. and South Korea. T-Mobile is the
                            only major U.S. operator that hasn’t used Samsung for 5G – but the vendor has deals with AT&amp;T, <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/samsung-joins-ericsson-nokia-as-5g-vendors-for-u-s-cellular">U.S. Cellular</a>,
                            in addition to Verizon. It’s also supporting 5G deployments in Japan, and expanded to markets like <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/samsung-breaks-into-canadian-market-5g-lte-a-for-videotron">Canada</a> and
                            <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/samsung-ramps-network-reach-signs-new-zealand-5g-deal">Spark</a> in New Zealand.</p>
                        <h4>Indoor&nbsp;sub-6 GHz 5G</h4>
                        <p>In addition to the new mmWave 5G small cell, Samsung is also introducing indoor 5G products that support low- and mid-band spectrum.</p>
                        <p>One is an active antenna system for medium to large enterprises. The other is designed for venues that already have distributed antenna systems (DAS), according to Samsung, to provide sub-6 GHz 5G services over existing in-building
                            infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>Kyung Mun, principal analyst at Mobile Experts, which closely tracks the DAS and small cell markets, said delivering on the promise of 5G, including high-speed and low-latency services, is going to require coordinated deployment
                            of sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands.</p>
                        <p>“We see a growing need for 5G infrastructure solutions that can support both millimeter wave spectrum and sub-6GHz licensed bands,” said Mun in comments emailed to Fierce. “Samsung’s indoor 5G solutions portfolio is an example
                            of such solution that addresses this need in support of the traditional mobile broadband and enterprise market opportunities in private wireless.”</p>
                        <p>Samsung expects commercial deployments of its indoor sub-6 GHz 5G products to start in the first quarter of 2021.</p>

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Select Spectrum plans to broker CBRS spectrum transactions</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 24, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Linda Hardesty</span>
                    <div>
                        <p>Select Spectrum is a spectrum broker that’s been around for 10 years. It has already facilitated deals amounting to more than $400 million, primarily bringing together lessors and lessees of spectrum in the Educational Broadband
                            Service (EBS) portion of the 2.5 GHz band. Now, the company is well-positioned to act as a spectrum broker in the CBRS band, and it’s gearing up to do just that.</p>
                        <p>The company cut its teeth by brokering 2.5 GHz spectrum. The FCC originally set aside the EBS portion of the 2.5 GHz band for use by educational institutions. However, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai noted in July 2019 that most&nbsp;licensees
                            didn't&nbsp;use the spectrum for educational purposes. Instead, they leased the spectrum to earn revenue.</p>
                        <p>Pai said in a 2019 statement, “An overwhelming number of today’s EBS licensees lease an overwhelming amount of EBS spectrum out to wireless companies. Indeed, over 95% of current license holders for our 2,193 EBS licenses today
                            lease much of this spectrum to non-educators.”</p>
                        <p>Much of that leasing activity went through Select Spectrum. The company set up its <a href="https://www.selectspectrum.com/spectrum-marketplace" rel="nofollow">Spectrum Marketplace</a> as an online platform to bring lessors and
                            lessees of 2.5 GHz (EBS/BRS) licenses together.</p>
                        <p>In April 2020, the FCC implemented rules, allowing the sale of those licenses. Whether before April 2020 or after, the majority of transactions involved Sprint/T-Mobile, either leasing or buying the available EBS spectrum. Again,
                            much of that activity happened on Select Spectrum’s Marketplace.</p>
                        <p><strong>CBRS</strong></p>
                        <p>Now, Select Spectrum is plotting its moves as a broker in the CBRS secondary market. It plans to roll out its new web platform CBRS Direct in early 2021&nbsp;after Priority Access Licenses (PALs) are granted by the FCC to the Auction
                            105 winners.</p>
                        <p>The company said CBRS Direct is a natural extension to&nbsp;the success it’s achieved in the 2.5 GHz band&nbsp;and also via dozens of transactions in the 3.65 GHz (NN) band, a predecessor to CBRS.</p>
                        <p>The CBRS Direct platform will provide a transaction platform for PAL spectrum owners to monetize their PALs and for prospective users across a myriad of industries to access PAL spectrum.</p>
                        <p>Andreas Bitzarakis, director of broadband at Select Spectrum, said the CBRS Direct platform will also include support for partitioning and disaggregation of licenses. Partitioning involves the division of licenses along geographic
                            lines for a portion of a license area, while disaggregation refers to spectrally segmenting a license by frequency for less than the full bandwidth.</p>
                        <p>Partitioning will allow for small-scale transactions, perhaps down to the census tract level or lower.</p>

                            Direct will provide these users with access to spectrum on a sub-county basis. This is often desired for businesses that just need spectrum to cover their manufacturing facility, for instance, or to cover a sports venue, as
                            another example.</p>
                        <p>On the flip side, PAL owners can also lease a portion of their county-sized licenses.</p>
                        <p>“A lot of folks who have PALs won’t need to operate in the full county,” said Bitzarakis. “The critical part is that it can facilitate partial counties.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Relationship to SAS</strong></p>
                        <p>Select Spectrum plans for CBRS Direct to interface directly with one or more of the FCC’s designated <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-a-cbrs-spectrum-access-system">Spectrum Access System (SAS)</a> databases while still operating independently of any specific SAS operator.</p>
                        <p>There’s been some talk that the SAS administrators — Google, Federated Wireless, Sony, CommScope and Amdocs — would be in the perfect position to act as spectrum transaction brokers. They could simply upgrade their SAS databases
                            to include a financial transaction aspect.</p>
                        <p>Federated Wireless CTO Kurt Schaubach told Fierce, “We do think the secondary market is going to be healthy due to the PAL use-it or lose-it rule, and we think we’d be in a great position to manage that market since we have the
                            PAL data and could re-assign and enforce the changes in real time.”</p>
                        <p>Although Select Spectrum is communicating with the SAS administrators, it doesn’t think it’s necessary for its spectrum brokerage platform to be connected to the SAS database.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Zachary Thompson, Select Spectrum’s manager of sales and analytics, said, “We’re transacting the title to the asset. Whereas the SAS are concerned with broadcasting. We could do a transaction, and the SAS has no relevance for the
                            transaction itself. There’s a difference from being good at coordinating spectrum and understanding the legal and financial aspects.”</p>
                        <p>Select Spectrum could end up being a competitor to any SAS administrator that decides to go into the brokerage business.</p>

                    <img sec="https://qtxasset.com/styles/breakpoint_xl_880px_w/s3/fiercewireless/1600979429/DSC09455.jpg?gdveaOpGG3vZzoCI4rqzVbgZ8Khouf.a&itok=3X_Jgs5s"> McAllen school district says every student can now access the internet thanks to
                    a city-funded CBRS network. (McAllen ISD)
                    <div property="schema:articleBody">
                        <p>The global pandemic hit hard in McAllen, Texas, a town just 11 miles from the Mexican border. With a 2.5% infection rate, McAllen city officials knew they should not send students and teachers back into school buildings. "We were
                            one of the hotspots in the country. Hospitalization rates were up, number of cases&nbsp;were up, so we had to go 100%&nbsp;remote," said McAllen Independent School District Superintendent J.A. Gonzalez.</p>
                        <p>In a way, McAllen ISD was ready for remote learning&nbsp;because for years the city has budgeted funds to enable digital education for its 21,000 students. Every elementary student in the district receives an iPad, and every secondary&nbsp;school
                            student gets a Chromebook. The students use these regularly in classroom settings, but not at home. "The problem was connectivity," explained Gonzalez. "We are&nbsp;72% economically disadvantaged, so a lot of our students didn't
                            have internet," he said.</p>
                        <p>Initially, the district purchased more than 8,000 Wi-Fi hotspots for homes without connectivity. But Gonzalez soon learned that this was not an adequate solution, since many parts of the city had no Wi-Fi for the hotspots to connect
                            to. Families were going to parks and fast food restaurants to get Wi-Fi so that students could try to do their homework.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>McAllen's city government stepped in to help, working with Frontera Consulting, a South Texas&nbsp;consultant that has wireless network expertise.&nbsp;According to Frontera co-founder Drew Lentz, the city approved a budget of
                            $3.9 million for the network as part of a larger $6 million project. He said McAllen&nbsp;followed all federal guidelines and stipulations so that they could submit the expenses for the network to be reimbursed by CARES funding
                            that was received by Hidalgo County, where McAllen is located.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Cambium Networks and Federated Wireless provided the equipment and expertise to build the network. Antennas are mounted&nbsp;on city water towers, and fixed wireless access points are attached to city&nbsp;light poles.&nbsp;The
                            solution includes 24 Cambium PMP 450m&nbsp;base stations and more than 1,000 Cambium outdoor Wi-Fi access points. Spectrum controller services, which ensure that the network does not interfere with incumbent users,&nbsp;are
                            provided at no cost by Federated Wireless. </p>

                        <p>“The deployment of this network delivers on one of the core capabilities of <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">CBRS</a>, which is to extend wireless connectivity to rural areas that traditionally
                            have not had a level playing field with the rest of the country,” said Matt Mangriotis, director of product management at Cambium Networks, in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>"From what we've seen so far, our teachers have been doing a tremendous job," said Gonzalez. "Students are uploading their assignments and turning in their assignments and interacting with their classmates, and we're doing the
                            very best that we can based on the circumstances, but it would not be possible without the connectivity."&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The CBRS network was built to enable remote learning but is available to all residents of McAllen. "Every child, parent and senior citizen who needs connectivity now has it. When you look at McAllen, we’re now not only a ‘Connected
                            City,’ we’re a digital leader," said McAllen Mayor Jim Darling.</p>

                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 22, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Linda Hardesty </span>
                    <div property="schema:articleBody">
                        <p>Analyst Iain Gillott, founder and president of iGR, said he was disappointed in the recent <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">CBRS spectrum</a> auction because it didn’t get as much involvement
                            from enterprises as it might have.</p>
                        <p>In terms of the goal of having a multitude of organizations and enterprises bidding for spectrum and driving up the prices, Gillott said, “I don’t think it did what it was supposed to do.”</p>
                        <p>Yes, Deere &amp; Company and Chevron won priority access licenses (PALs), but Gillott pointed out that only four universities got licenses, even though educational institutions around the country are active users of the unlicensed
                            portion of the CBRS spectrum. “In that respect I think the CBRS PALs were a failure. I don’t think four universities was a success.”</p>
                        <p>He speculates that the reason more universities and enterprises didn’t participate in the CBRS Auction 105&nbsp;was that the county-sized licenses covered too much geography and cost too much for these entities. Many organizations&nbsp;only
                            need spectrum to cover their campuses, public venues or industrial locations. They couldn’t afford to buy a PAL for the&nbsp;entirety of LA County, for example.</p>
                        <p>When plans for the CBRS auction were being hammered out a few years ago, regulators considered auctioning licenses at the smaller census level rather than the county level, but it would have been a more complicated auction, and
                            that plan got nixed.</p>
                        <p>“Carriers want to get as big an area as possible and have as few other bidders as possible,” said Gillott.</p>
                        <p>Mobile Experts analyst Kyung Mun said if the FCC had made the geographic areas smaller it would have driven up participation&nbsp;and decreased costs. “But that was already discussed for years and would have decreased the appetite
                            for the bigger players," said Mun.&nbsp;"The FCC made a compromise.”</p>
                        <p>In terms of the final $4.5 billion proceeds of the auction, Mun said, “It was higher than I expected.” He had&nbsp;been forecasting CBRS auction results for a couple of years. In June 2019 he estimated $2.2 billion, and in June
                            2020 he boosted his forecast to $3.4 billion. “I knew it was going to go up, but it was bigger than I thought despite the fact that AT&amp;T didn’t participate,” said Mun.</p>
                        <p>Gillott also thought the final proceeds “were actually pretty good.” But he wonders about the proceeds from the upcoming C-BAND auction in December. Organizations and enterprises aren’t expected to participate in this auction.
                            With only mobile carriers and cable operator participation, how much competitive bidding can be expected?</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondary market</strong></p>
                        <p>Just because more enterprises and other organizations didn’t obtain PALs, doesn’t mean that they won’t use CBRS spectrum for private wireless networks. They can still use the unlicensed&nbsp;general authorized access (GAA) portion
                            of the CBRS band. And they are also likely to obtain PALs through the secondary market, leasing PAL spectrum from other companies that own it.</p>
                        <p>The mandatory “quiet period” for CBRS spectrum — where companies were not permitted to talk about their bidding plans or spectrum-use plans — ended last week. So, we may start to see some activity on the secondary market.</p>
                        <p>The <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-a-cbrs-spectrum-access-system">spectrum access system (SAS)</a> administrators could be poised as the perfect entities to create secondary market exchanges, bringing
                            spectrum lessors and lessees together for potential financial transactions. Their SAS databases and algorithms already manage the sharing of CBRS spectrum, making sure there’s no interference in the band.</p>
                        <p>Mun said of the SAS administrators, “I think they’re very well-positioned to do that. They’re in good position to be that broker. They’d have to create that exchange platform software system.”</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the secondary market: Dish acquired a lot of PALs, and could be well-positioned as a lessor in the secondary market. Gillott said Dish got 10 MHz of CBRS spectrum in “nearly every county in the U.S.” He noted that many
                            of these counties have a major highway running through them. “We can speculate on their strategy all day long and probably get no closer to the truth,” said Gillott.</p>
                        <p>But Dish has the potential to be an active player in the CBRS secondary market.</p>
                        <p>Mun said of Dish, “Their appetite for spectrum seems to be never ending. It’s a strategic asset for them that does not depreciate over time.”</p>

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Cambium meshes Wi-Fi 6, 60 GHz for fiber-like speeds</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 22, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Bevin Fletcher </span>
                    <div property="schema:articleBody">
                        <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Cambium Networks likes to say that wireless is the new fiber. And with the introduction of new 60 GHz products featuring multi-gigabit meshing capabilities, the company is looking to make it easier to deploy cost-effective, high-speed
                            networks.</p>
                        <p>It’s an extension of Cambium’s expertise in fixed wireless broadband, which the company has been doing for more than a decade, and combines with Wi-Fi 6 products that debuted <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/cambium-embraces-60-ghz-wi-fi-6-for-multi-gigabit-connectivity">over the summer</a>.
                            The solution uses Facebook Connectivity’s Terragraph technology and Qualcomm’s latest 802.11ay-compliant chips and software.</p>
                        <p>While licensed high-band millimeter wave spectrum gets attention as carriers like Verizon use it to roll out 5G fixed services, Cambium’s wireless network products support the unlicensed 60 GHz band to extend Wi-Fi throughput or
                            serve as wireless backhaul in place of wired networks. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The fact that 60 GHz is unlicensed is good news, says Dino Bekis, VP and general manager of Qualcomm’s Mobile &amp; Compute Connectivity business, because it enables more competition and there are already mechanisms in place for
                            effective sharing. Another benefit Bekis called out is that 60 GHz is largely available continuously throughout much of the world, without other applications already consuming the frequencies.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Qualcomm <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/qualcomm-unveils-60-ghz-wi-fi-chipsets-for-wigig-devices">debuted</a> a family of 60 GHz Wi-Fi chipsets in 2018 and was involved earlier this year in <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/qualcomm-facebook-google-want-new-rules-for-60-ghz">advocating</a>,
                            alongside Facebook and others, improved regulatory framework for unlicensed use in the band.</p>
                        <p>The .11 ay-compliant Qualcomm technology in Cambium’s network products supports a greater number of channels.</p>
                        <p>Compared to its work in lower frequencies like 2.5 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 5 GHz for fixed wireless – 60 GHz is “a very different beast,” Cambium CEO Atul Bhatnagar told Fierce Wireless. The short range of high mmWave frequencies can
                            make it more challenging, but that’s where Cambium brings in features like meshing.</p>
                        <p>“[60 GHz] is a phenomenal spectrum and as a result we can do multi-gigabit networks and for the first time we have fiber-like speeds wirelessly,” he noted.</p>
                        <p>Operators can deploy a wireless fabric using different frequencies, with simplified management happening together from the cloud. For example, Cambium’s Wi-Fi 6 architecture serves the last 300-400 meters, and then a 60 GHz-type
                            architecture a kilometer or two out.</p>
                        <p>“This combination of Wi-Fi 6 plus 60 GHz gives us a wireless fabric that starts to bridge LAN and WAN,” Bhatnagar said. “As we provide meshing capability in this product, that then stretches into a few more kilometers.”</p>
                        <p>The ability to deploy a mesh network is key and something Bekis said Cambium is on the forefront of.</p>
                        <p>A mesh network enables scalability, dense deployments and cost-effective implementation to bring broadband to more people, he noted. In addition to less specialized infrastructure and advanced training needed for rollouts, the
                            new .11 ay-compliant products can fit into existing networks and ensure interoperability with future network elements. Bekis said it lowers the risk for operators to take on deployments and adds confidence in the ability to
                            scale up.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately it could open up high-speed access to people who might not otherwise have the option because of cost barriers for both operators and consumers.</p>
                        <p>“This really opens up the door for this more ubiquitous ability for people to take advantage of high-speed connectivity and internet access,” Bekis said.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h4>Deployments for urban, rural communities</h4>
                        <p>Cambium has largely focused on connecting suburban and rural areas, but the new 60 GHz system is its first to target the urban environment.</p>
                        <p>Compared to digging trenches for fiber or requiring additional truck rolls, Cambium says 60 GHz for last-kilometer connectivity or backhaul can mean lower cost of ownership, lower cost of deployment and easier implementation.</p>
                        <p>In dense urban settings, Bhatnagar said 60 GHz can provide enough throughput, for example, to connect numerous cameras in a video surveillance network and backhaul properly. Similarly, 60 GHz can help an operator that’s deploying
                            small cells in an urban setting and has to navigate structures, with meshing capabilities or sufficient backhaul.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to wireless internet service providers (WISPs) in more suburban or rural settings, “they can offer 100s of megabits per second throughput, matching wired networks in developing communities,” Bhatnagar said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <nav aria-label="Tabs" role="navigation">
                            <p>Cambium is just starting the lifecycle of its 60 GHz products, gaining learnings from ongoing customer trials that are going very well, according to Bhatnagar. During trials customers typically look at things like deployability,
                                diagnostics, management and RF noise. After those successfully wrap up, deployments will start, first usually by populating the edge network with subscriber modules.</p>
                            <p>It’s a multi-year expansion, Bhatnagar said, and will continue into 2021-2022.</p>
                            <p>While rollouts will take time, Bekis said 60 GHz will “make a difference in people’s lives long-term” for fixed wireless, on par with some of the wireless innovations in cellular and broadband space in the last couple of years.</p>

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Ericsson targets enterprise with $1.1B Cradlepoint acquisition</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 18, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Bevin Fletcher </span>
                    <div property="schema:articleBody">
                        <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Swedish telecom equipment giant Ericsson is acquiring U.S.-based Cradlepoint for $1.1 billion, as it looks to expand its presence and accelerate 5G adoption in the enterprise market.</p>
                        <p>Headquartered in Boise, Idaho, Cradlepoint is one of the leaders in the cellular-based wireless wide area network (WAN) edge market and is poised to grow revenue by more than 30% this year, according to Ericsson. With around 675
                            employees, Cradlepoint will continue operating under its current brand as a fully owned subsidiary of Ericsson. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Cradlepoint primarily serves the U.S., providing 4G connectivity products including wireless routers to enterprises, small and medium businesses and public safety agencies. It helps connect things like branch offices, mobile workforces,
                            ambulances, and IoT devices. Ericsson noted Cradlepoint has more than 1 million active subscriptions for its network cloud software as a service (SaaS) platform that offers zero-touch on-boarding.</p>
                        <p>While most deployments have been 4G, Cradlepoint has a full portfolio of 5G-ready products. Over the summer the company discussed the <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/cradlepoint-eyes-cbrs-spectrum-to-offer-private-lte-as-escape-from-wi-fi">opportunity for private LTE</a> for enterprises using Citizens Broadband Radio Service (<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs#:~:text=Citizens%20Broadband%20Radio%20Service%20(CBRS,PAL)%20users%20and%20general%20authorized">CBRS</a>)
                            spectrum. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>“Portfolio-near acquisitions are an integral part of our earlier communicated strategy. The acquisition of Cradlepoint complements our existing offerings and is key to our strategy of helping customers grow the value of their 5G
                            network investments,” said Ericsson President and CEO Börje Ekholm in a <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2020/9/ericsson-accelerates-5g-for-enterprise-with-acquisition-of-cradlepoint" rel="nofollow">statement.</a> “Ericsson is uniquely positioned to build on Cradlepoint’s leadership position in Wireless Edge and the wireless WAN market.”</p>
                        <p>Analysts at Cowen view the deal as “a well-conceived acquisition – strong strategic fit and a reasonable purchase price.”</p>
                        <p>It may also point to a more direct relationship with enterprises.</p>
                        <p>“Cradlepoint should help ERIC in the enterprise market, especially with respect to accelerating and expanding ERIC’s presence in addressing 5G enterprise market opportunities beyond ERIC’s traditional service provider market,”
                            wrote Cowen analysts in a Friday note to investors.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to rival Nokia, Ericsson has largely stayed away from going after enterprises directly, instead going through core service provider customer channels. In the announcement and during a media briefing call Ericsson appeared
                            to downplay that the acquisition may signal a shift in that strategy, calling it good news for operators.</p>
                        <p>“Many of our customers have been facing a touch and challenging situation,” said Ekholm. “Data growth in the network is exponential but service revenues are flat. This investment is part of our strategy to build a strong enterprise
                            offering and address our customers’ situation” by creating value through new revenue streams for them.</p>
                        <p>Cradlepoint has more than 20,000 customers and 1,500 channel partners. Ericsson noted that 10 service providers account for most of Cradlepoint’s revenues, which totaled $150 million in 2019 and are expected to grow to $200 million.
                            &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>In May, the company expanded its <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-expands-relationship-cradlepoint">relationship with AT&amp;T</a>, enabling public safety agencies to buy select Cradlepoint wireless edge solutions
                            including wireless routers directly from AT&amp;T.</p>
                        <p>“In CradlePoint, ERIC gains a focused private company that is the, or one of the, leader(s) in a young, fast growing, long-tailed market that should eventually inflect with the roll-out of 5G,” wrote Cowen analysts.</p>
                        <p>“We expect this enterprise opportunity to eventually inflect with adoption of industrial automation, IoT and other private enterprise 5G use cases following the roll-out of 5G networks,” the firm added.</p>
                        <h4>Expanding internationally</h4>
                        <p>Cradlepoint has a proven track record in the U.S., but Ekholm said they see significant potential to expand outside of North America. Executives called out opportunities from Ericsson’s large network of service provider relationships
                            globally to accelerate Cradlepoint’s international reach as bringing major value to the deal.</p>
                        <p>During the briefing Åsa Tamsons, Ericsson’s head of Business Area Technologies &amp; New Businesses, said the vendor will be very focused on working closely with mobile operators to bring Cradlepoint solutions “to them and through
                            them.”&nbsp;She noted that operators will probably play an even more important role to open up and expand the wireless WAN edge market outside of the U.S., in regions where it’s just getting started.</p>
                        <p>Ericsson views wireless WAN as a high-growing market, expected to grow to $4 billion by 2024&nbsp;and says&nbsp;Cradlepoint has around 25% share.<br><br> Cowen analysts said there’s significant opportunity for Ericsson to grow
                            Cradlepoint’s footprint and revenue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <nav aria-label="Tabs" role="navigation">
                            <p>“ERIC’s presence among service providers throughout the world—in terms of both customer relationships and in-region sales and sales support personnel—should be instrumental both in helping to drive market adoption outside of
                                the U.S. and in driving CradlePoint’s presence and revenue outside of the U.S.,” wrote the Cowen team.</p>
                            <p>The deal, funded by cash-in-hand, is expected to close before the end of the fourth quarter 2020. Ericsson projects it will negatively impact the Swedish vendor’s operating margins by 1% in 2021 and 2022, with Cradlepoint to
                                contribute to operating cash flow starting in 2022.</p>

                                <div> The FCC wrapped up the first round of the 3.5 GHz spectrum auction on Thursday, with 271 qualified bidders and strong demand.

                                    for mid-band spectrum in the shared Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) 3.55-3.65 GHz band. </div> Participants are vying for Priority Access Licenses (PALs) in county-based areas. In total there are 22,631 PALs,
                                with seven available in each county license area. Each PAL consists of an unpaired 10 MHz block, and licensees can aggregate up to four PAL channels within any county area at any given time. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon
                                and Dish are all participating. However, unlike earlier 5G auctions for millimeter wave spectrum, there are numerous smaller entities and untraditional players getting in on the action. That includes cable companies Cox
                                and Charter, but also the likes of Chevron, Deere &amp; Company, and Duke University and Health System, among others. Sasha Javid, COO at BitPath,&nbsp;<a href="https://sashajavid.com/FCC_Auction105.php" rel="nofollow">closely tracks</a>&nbsp;and
                                analyzes auction results, and in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-dawn-spectrum-sharing-fcc-cbrs-auction-gets-underway-sasha-javid/" rel="nofollow">post</a>&nbsp;called out the significant demand Auction
                                105 is seeing after round one. While strong, he noted demand is comparable to prior auctions. “The robust demand after the first round…is a very promising sign,” said Javid, who was chief data officer and legal advisor
                                for the FCC’s Incentive Auction Task Force in 2016. “I have to assume the FCC is happy with how the auction started.” Much of the early demand is in large markets including Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York. Javid told
                                Fierce via email that’s not surprising, because as seen in earlier auctions, it’s where large bidders “can safely park the bids in the early rounds.” &nbsp;Once the price for those areas increase as the auction continues,
                                bidders will move into the markets that they really want, he explained. Still, Auction 105 offers licenses in many less populous markets – and the market with the highest excess demand was Calhoun, Iowa. However, it does
                                not necessarily mean bidders have strong interest in the area. “Calhoun, IA and other cheap markets in the middle of the country are likely being used by some small bidders (of which there are many) to ensure that they
                                meet the activity rule requirements,” Javid said. “But I hope that in at least some of these smaller markets there is genuine interest to use the CBRS band to provide wireless broadband.” The nationwide price per MHz-POP
                                at the end of round one was $0.020031. The set-up of the CBRS band is unique, with tiered coordinated sharing among three levels of users, including protected incumbent federal operations.&nbsp;PALs come after federal users,
                                followed by General Authorized Access (GAA). The GAA tier is more similar to unlicensed access and deployments are already happening. Carriers have been waiting for a new opportunity for licensed mid-band spectrum for 5G,
                                but CBRS is also being used applications like fixed wireless and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/ongo-s-outlook-for-private-lte-deployments-cbrs-3-5-ghz-band">private LTE</a>, among others.

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">U.S. Cellular, the nation's fourth-largest wireless network operator, offered a few more details about its ongoing network-upgrade plans Monday, including its intention to improve its 5G network with millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum
                        and its 4G network with CBRS spectrum. The operator also said it plans to expand its existing 4G fixed wireless offering with mmWave 5G options. However, it's fair to say that U.S. Cellular's efforts are relatively modest, given
                        the operator's regional focus. The carrier counts around 5 million customers on a network that covers portions of Texas, Washington state, Maine, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Tennessee and elsewhere. U.S. Cellular isn't providing very
                        many specifics about its plans. The operator didn't offer any financial details about its network-upgrade efforts, nor did it say how much territory it would cover with either CBRS or mmWave. U.S. Cellular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/us-cellular-to-boost-capex-for-5g-adds-samsung-as-supplier/d/d-id/757664">previously said</a>&nbsp;its
                        capital expenses in 2020 could be as much as $950 million, in part due to 5G. That's far more than the $710 million the operator spent on its network and operations during 2019. Nonetheless, the company's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/27/nokia-and-us-cellular-team-up-for-5g-mmwave-to-modernize-5g-capabilities-for-enhanced-customer-experiences/">announcements</a>&nbsp;

                        Monday it is beginning a "multi-year deployment" of 5G services in its mmWave spectrum, and that it expects to launch commercial service sometime in 2021. The company said it would do so with 24GHz, 28GHz and 39GHz mmWave equipment
                        from Ericsson; 24GHz and 28GHz equipment from Nokia; and 28GHz equipment from Samsung. U.S. Cellular spent roughly $402 million&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/here-are-the-big-winners-in-the-fccs-24ghz-and-28ghz-5g-auctions/d/d-id/751903">across</a>&nbsp;

The company will start its mmWave deployment with macro towers and then augment that with small cells, essentially reiterating comments the company's CTO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/us-cellulars-cto-opens-up-about-5g/d/d-id/753383">made to Light Reading in 2019</a>.
                        However, U.S. Cellular representatives declined to answer questions about how many small cells it might deploy for the effort. U.S. Cellular initially launched 5G services on its 600MHz spectrum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/us-cellular-plots-600mhz-5g-in-iowa-and-wisconson-in-early-2020/d/d-id/754598">at the beginning of 2020</a>.
                        The company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/us-cellular-to-launch-5g-in-the-second-half-of-2019/d/d-id/749859">had initially</a>&nbsp;planned to launch 5G sometime in 2019, but a spokesperson told Light
                        Reading earlier this year the launch was pushed back due to the operator's inability to obtain devices for the service. U.S. Cellular launched the 5G Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphone in March; the gadget can support 5G in
                        both mmWave and 600MHz spectrum bands. U.S. Cellular's move to add mmWave spectrum to its existing 600MHz 5G deployment should dramatically increase customers' speeds, but only in select areas. That's because 5G in mmWave
                        spectrum can generally support blazing fast-speeds, albeit across relatively tiny coverage areas. Meantime, 5G signals in 600MHz spectrum generally support speeds similar to 4G, albeit across vast geographic areas. U.S.
                        Cellular has so far declined to charge extra for 5G. The company confirmed it will use 5G in mmWave spectrum for both fixed and mobile applications. The company is already offering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscellular.com/high-speed-internet-provider">fixed Internet services on its 4G network</a>&nbsp;starting
                        at $50 per month for 25GB of data. U.S. Cellular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/verizon-dont-expect-much-from-5g-home-until-h2-2020/d/d-id/756677">will join Verizon and others</a>&nbsp;in using mmWave
                        spectrum to offer fixed Internet services inside homes and offices. <strong>CBRS intentions</strong> Tucked away in U.S. Cellular's announcement Monday was its agreement with Ericsson to purchase "4G Citizens Broadband
                        Radio Service (CBRS) equipment and services as U.S. Cellular continues its 5G modernization program." A U.S. Cellular representative declined to answer questions about that statement, but company executives&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/4g-lte/us-cellular-joins-verizon-atandt-in-eyeing-35-ghz-cbrs-operations/d/d-id/753696">have previously told Light Reading</a>&nbsp;that
                        U.S. Cellular was considering using CBRS spectrum for network augmentation. Specifically, U.S. Cellular CTO Michael Irizarry told Light Reading that the operator could use 3.5GHz CBRS spectrum as a way to add additional
                        capacity to its network, as it currently does via LAA technology in the 5GHz band for 4G. It's yet unclear whether U.S. Cellular will use CBRS spectrum on a licensed or unlicensed basis. The company is currently registered
                        to participate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/verizon-expected-to-go-big-in-cbrs-35ghz-auction/d/d-id/761918">in the FCC's ongoing CBRS spectrum auction</a>. Winners in that auction will gain exclusive use
                        over a portion of the band. However, another portion of the band is being held for unlicensed uses.</div> Mike Dano

                            one that could wind up delivering for the FCC, says one veteran auction executive. After tripling its $107,991,840 reserve price in the first, six-hour, round Thursday (July 2e), to close with net proceeds of $357,344,200,
                            the auction has been progressing at a more measured pace in the two, two-hour rounds the FCC is now holding per day. After round three, the proceeds were $388,732,380, which ticked up to $424,882,023 after round four, both
                            on Friday. As of the end of Monday's (July 27) first round, the total was $455,953,607. The FCC is auctioning 70 MHz worth of county-based Priority Access Licenses (PALs) (a whopping 22,631 of them) in the 3550-3650 MHz 93.5
                            GHz) band. It is the most-ever flexible-use licenses available in a single auction, the FCC said. Each license will be a 10 MHz unpaired channel. There are 271 qualified bidders. Currently, there are 1,184 counties where bidding
                            demand for spectrum exceeds the supply. "With 271 qualified bidders and licenses starting cheap for county-level licenses, I guess that [demand] is not surprising,' says BitPath COO Sasha Javid. "If demand stays this robust,
                            the FCC will be very happy." Javid is former FCC chief data officer and was legal advisor to the FCC Incentive Auction Task Force.

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Five verticals that are exploring the use of CBRS</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">July 28, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Kelly Hill </span>
                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">In its first seven months of full commercial deployment, most of the use of the shared Citizens Broadband Radio Service is being driven by two predictable use cases: Network capacity augmentation and fixed wireless broadband access,
                        both on the networks of existing cellular operators and/or wireless ISPs. That’s not a surprise, as enterprises who would consider CBRS for private networks don’t have the same level of familiarity with operating cellular networks.
                        But enterprise use cases are being explored nonetheless, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.celona.io/" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">CBRS start-up Celona</a>&nbsp;is aiming squarely at bringing together
                        what CTO Mehmet Yavuz calls “three DNAs”: enterprise IT, cellular and cloud, and making CBRS “consumable” for enterprise IT. “Our opportunity here, really, is to bridge the gap between these three different worlds: Between the
                        cloud, between the cellular telco industry and enterprise networking IT,” he said. Celona, which was founded in the spring of 2019 and raised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.celona.io/resources/celona-raises-10m" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">$10 million in venture capital funding</a>&nbsp;last fall, is in its pre-release/beta phase but has already been working with multiple customers to deploy CBRS networks. Celona VP of Marketing Ozer Dondurmacioglu
                        said that among the enterprise CBRS trials that Celona is supporting, there are a few common themes: The specific devices and/or applications that the businesses want to run on CBRS LTE are considered mission-critical. Some of
                        them need to stay up 24/7. And all of them are enterprise-owned and staff-operated, whether they are remotely operated computer-vision cameras or devices carried by employees on-premise. “Enterprises spent a lot of time and money
                        purchasing, deploying, supporting, managing, training their staff on [these], and they want to run that stuff on relatively predictable, clean spectrum, which CBRS LTE promises them,” Dondurmacioglu said. He described five verticals
                        where Celona is supporting CBRS networks: -Healthcare: “In healthcare, we’re seeing iPhones that are assigned to clinical staff running voice over IP applications, most likely tied to corporate PBX, as doctors and nurses are on
                        the move,” said Dondurmacioglu. “These iPhones stay within the hospital … and they’re being used in that facility. Outdoor usage is increasing, based on the feedback that we’re hearing from them, because of the unfortunate covid
                        situation, they are trying to serve their audiences in outdoor facilities as well.” -Logistics: These are operations that need 24/7 network operations, Dondurmacioglu noted. “We’re all buying things online now and it’s becoming
                        more and more important, and in order to meet those strict timelines that they have, they’re looking at a clean spectrum for staff-operated iPads, ruggedized tablets, and phones — again, enterprise-owned, staff operated.” -Corporate
                        enterprise: In this segment, he said, Celona is seeing “some traction toward employee devices being installed with physical SIM cards to enable private LTE” and has one customer going in that direction.&nbsp; “It’s an interesting
                        idea to have some of their employees running on CBRS LTE in case they focus on sensitive communications and they need high levels of predictable, measurable reliability on that link,” Dondurmacioglu said. -Transportation: Another
                        instance of a vertical that operates 24/7. Dondurmacioglu said that when it comes to specific connectivity needs such as cranes, which rely on various computers and sensors, “you either cable them or you try to run them on a public
                        mobile network or on Wi-Fi or CBRS LTE. Some of them have been considering CBRS LTE” to keep control of their data and network and again, have access to spectrum where interference is not an issue. Higher education: This is Celona’s
                        leading segment, according to Dondurmacioglu, and the pandemic is driving networking changes as colleges and universities grapple with how to either re-open their campuses or support students and staff who are already on-campus
                        for various reasons. Multiple universities are also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200707/spectrum/271-bidders-will-compete-for-cbrs-pals" data-wpel-link="internal">qualified bidders</a>&nbsp;in the ongoing CBRS Priority
                        Access License auction. “Higher education is evolving their needs. … They’re looking at outdoor classrooms, and they’re looking at additional wireless broadband for residence halls where the Ph.D. students and some of their researchers
                        cannot leave the campus, they have to work within the campus. They are staying in residential halls, so they need that additional broadband.” For when students come back, Dondurmacioglu continued, some colleges and universities
                        are “considering outdoor classrooms, weather-permitting, in outdoor areas where nobody used to do anything — like parking lots. You don’t usually think about covering a parking lot with solid wireless connectivity. Now they’re
                        looking at CBRS as a backhaul for Wi-Fi hot spots to be able to do that.” According to Celona, in a coverage-based network design with relatively low- to medium-density operations, one CBRS site can cover about a million square
                        feet, compared to about 100,000 square feet for a general Wi-Fi outdoor AP. (The company offers a&nbsp;<a href="https://planner.celona.io/#/pages/home" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">free online planning tool</a>&nbsp;for
                        CBRS networks so that companies can see how much spectrum is available in their area and how many access points would be needed for their network type and expected density of devices.) That significant difference in coverage, Yavuz
                        explained, is a function of both the “ideal” nature of 3.5 GHz spectrum for enterprise use, the transmit power differences between CBRS and Wi-Fi, and the higher sensitivity levels of reception in LTE systems versus Wi-Fi, particularly
                        on the uplink. “3.5 [GHz] is really almost ideal for many use cases, because you don’t necessary want a low band, which is only for outdoor use,” he said. “Many use cases are local and indoors, or around a locality. But it’s also
                        much better than 5 or 6 GHz in terms of the propagation characteristics. You don’t necessarily need miles and miles [of coverage], so that you have a lot of interference between the enterprises, but it’s good coverage for the needs
                        of those parking lots or the transportation hubs and airports and so forth.”</div> Kelly Hill

                                    broadband solution, based on the PMP 450m platform and incorporating Cambium’s cnMedusa massive multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology. Cambium is not a&nbsp;CBRS Spectrum Access System (SAS) administrator, but it offers
                                    SAS services through a cloud-based management system. Cambium customers can upgrade devices and migrate to CBRS with an over-the-air software upgrade. Its software-defined radio design is part of why customer transitions
                                    to CBRS are already complete or are underway, the company said. Under the new sharing paradigm of the 3.5 GHz band, current licensees in the 3.65 GHz portion operating under the FCC’s Part 90 rules must migrate their
                                    services and equipment to CBRS band standards by October 17. The original deadline was in mid-April, but the FCC granted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/wisps-catch-a-break-cbrs-transition">temporary extension</a>&nbsp;for
                                    some, including WISPs and electric utilities, so that they could stay focused on providing broadband services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Before CBRS came to be, there were already around 125,000 Cambium Part 90 devices
                                    (also called “3.65”) deployed, which the provider said makes the software upgrade capability particularly attractive. Those that don’t transition before the deadline have to either stop operating or face a rush to migrate
                                    to CBRS, Cambium added. Of the 20,000 devices, the majority (between 80-90%) were existing deployments that migrated from the old Part 90 rules to Part 96 via a software upgrade, according to a spokesperson. “CBRS spectrum
                                    is a precious natural resource, and effectively exercising it requires long-term planning and vision,” Cambium Networks CEO Atul Bhatnagar said in a statement. “Having that combination of vision, services and experience
                                    makes it very clear to us that operators must act now, both to take advantage of CBRS opportunities already in play and to avoid missing the opportunity before the deadline,” Bhatnagar continued. Cambium has also worked
                                    with Google and Federated Wireless, two of five certified SAS administrators. The other three are Amdocs, Commscope, and Sony. Federated worked with Cambium on the CBRS band as far back as March 2019 when the pair&nbsp;

Fixed wireless connectivity
                        currently represents the primary use case for CBRS. Cambium has established a significant lead in adoption of CBRS fixed wireless, with approximately 20,000 CBRS devices now deployed by over 150 service provider customers.
                        The deployments already in place are helping drive faster and more accessible broadband to meet rural, suburban, local government, and enterprise needs across the US. CBRS, utilizing 3,550-3,700 MHz spectrum, has a wide variety

                        current licenses managed under the FCC's Part 90 rules. Operators who do not migrate ahead of the deadline will be forced to cease operation or rush a migration to CBRS. Thanks to Cambium's software-defined radio design and
                        unmatched combination of vision, services, and real-world experience with CBRS, the transition to the new band is either complete or well underway for its customers via a relatively simple software upgrade. The ability to migrate
                        to CBRS with an over-the-air-upgrade is especially attractive to the approximately 125,000 Cambium Networks' Part 90 devices, also known as "3.65", deployed prior to the advent of CBRS. "The longevity of Cambium equipment is

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">The FCC's midband CBRS spectrum auction topped $500 million Tuesday (July 28) after round-six bidding that pushed the total up by over $60 million to $519,155,888. The auction, the FCC's first-ever flexible-license mid-band auction,
                        began with a single, six-hour, round; moved to two, two-hour rounds, for the succeeding two days, and on Wednesday (July 29), will shift to three, hour-and-a-half rounds until further notice, which is at least through Thursday,
                        according to the FCC's web site. The FCC is auctioning 70 MHz worth of county-based Priority Access Licenses (PALs) (a whopping 22,631 of them) in the 3550-3650 MHz 93.5 GHz) band. It is the most-ever flexible-use licenses available
                        in a single auction, the FCC said. Each license will be a 10 MHz unpaired channel. There are 271 qualified bidders. The band is being shared by federal and non-federal users, with incumbents--Navy radar, for example--having the
                        top priority, followed by PALs and then general authorized users (GAAs). Sasha Javid, COO of BitPath and former top FCC auction official, says that a couple of the key questions the auction should answer is how much Verizon, AT&amp;T
                        and T-Mobile/Sprint is willing to pay for spectrum that requires frequency coordination and "strict" power limits and whether Charter and Comcast (or Dish) will "take the plunge" and bid "in a meaningful way."</div> JOHN EGGERTON

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">After eight rounds of bidding, gross proceeds at the FCC auction for Priority Access Licenses (PALs) in the CBRS band inched toward $600 million, with Wednesday morning’s first round adding about $37 million in incremental bids.
                        <div id="content-embed-one-wrapper">
                            <div id="content-embed-one">There are still two rounds to go on Wednesday, as the format shifted to three, hour-and-a-half rounds per day. Gross proceeds in Auction 105 <a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction105" rel="nofollow">stood</a>&nbsp;at

                        </div> However, the auction for spectrum in the shared 3.55-3.65 GHz band is different from earlier auctions and analysts at New Street Research believe the ultimate aggregate amount raised is less of an indicator of success than more subtle
                        factors. “The CBRS auction is not about how much the spectrum is worth,” New Street’s Blair Levin wrote in a weekend note to investors. “It’s about whether there are new disruptive business models for niche services.” The unique sharing
                        paradigm of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">Citizens Broadband Radio Service</a>&nbsp;(CBRS) band includes three tiers of users, with PALs in the middle – below federal incumbents and above
                        General Authorized Access (GAA) use. The latter is already available for commercial use. RELATED:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/cbrs-private-network-put-to-test-by-utah-school-district">CBRS private network put to the test by Utah school district</a> In Auction 105 there is 70 MHz of spectrum at play licensed on a county basis, with 22,631 in total. Each PAL consists of an unpaired 10 MHz block, and licensees can aggregate up to four PAL channels within any county area at any given
                        time. The FCC said it represents the most-ever flexible-use licenses available in a single auction. The auction also presents an opportunity for non-traditional and smaller players to get in on the action and there are 271 qualified
                        bidders. At the end of Round 8, the nationwide price per MHz POP was $0.031578, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://sashajavid.com/FCC_Auction105.php" rel="nofollow">tracking</a>&nbsp;by BitPath COO Sasha Javid. While price might not
                        be the star of the show, demand in early rounds has been on par with earlier auctions. After round 8 there were still 1,011 county areas out of 3,233 with greater demand than supply. Javid’s data shows the five counties with the largest
                        excess demand after round 8 include Los Angles; Fulton, Georgia; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Lea, New Mexico; and Arlington Virginia. Excess demand for Los Angeles stands at 25, with the next three counties at 24, and excess demand in Arlington
                        at 22 – versus supply of just seven for each county. Out of the 20 counties with the most excess demand, the remaining 15 all had at last 20 above supply. New Street over the weekend said that the excessive demand in earlier rounds
                        points to potential for increased disruption ahead. The firm acknowledged that early bidding is not a definite indicator of where demand will ultimately land, but said the first rounds suggest that unique aspects of CBRS, including
                        lower power limits and sharing “are not, at least so far, suppressing demand,” Levin wrote. Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss expects that slow incremental bids in early rounds will pick up pace in the coming weeks, noting excess
                        demand in counties with over half of the U.S. POPs. Estimates on the final proceeds tally vary, and while Raymond James acknowledged predicting the final price is difficult, the firm pegged Auction 105 at generating between $8 billion
                        and $10 billion. New Street, meanwhile, has a much lower base forecast of around $3 billion. The firm noted that it's unlikely CBRS will be used for broad regional or national services but that it gives niche providers opportunities
                        for low-cost spectrum, and traditional providers the option to get less expensive mid-band spectrum to augment their existing services. Verizon has already been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/verizon-s-cbrs-3-5-ghz-deployments-rise-rootmetrics">deploying 3.5 GHz</a>&nbsp;in
                        a number of markets using the GAA portion of the band. Cambium Networks, meanwhile, this week said that around 20,000 of the company’s CBRS devices have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/cambium-pushes-pedal-cbrs-20k-devices-deployed">already been deployed</a>&nbsp;across
                        more than 150 service provider customers. Cambium cited fixed wireless as the leading use case for deployments of its CBRS devices.

                        auction, New Street cited, “the extent to which incumbents can use shared spectrum to reduce their cost structure, cable can use CBRS to provide their own wireless services, and new providers who control specific areas, such as universities
                        and office park owners, can use the spectrum to offer niche services.” Another important piece is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/amid-heated-debate-fcc-votes-3-2-to-free-up-280-mhz-c-band-for-5g">C-band auction</a>,
                        which is set to kick off December 8, with 280 MHz of licensed mid-band spectrum on the table.&nbsp; That’s largely seen as a more key auction for major carriers as they need more mid-band spectrum to build out 5G and the C-band auction
                        offers large channel sizes ranging from 20 MHz up to 100 MHz. Verizon in particular is largely expected to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-turns-dynamic-spectrum-sharing-parts-north-texas">bid aggressively</a>.
                        With C-band coming up soon, New Street said mobile carriers might not bid as heavily in the ongoing CBRS auction than if the former was on a more distant timeline. “In light of these factors, the aggregate number may not reflect the
                        true, long-term impact of the [CBRS] auction,”&nbsp;Levin wrote. Compared to its $3 billion&nbsp;estimate for the CBRS auction, New Street thinks C-band could generate around $52 billion.</div> Bevin Fletcher

                                Kodali wrote.</div>
                        </section>Roughly two years ago in September 2018, AT&amp;T&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-selects-samsung-commscope-for-cbrs-network-deployment">picked Samsung</a>&nbsp;to supply its 5G-ready CBRS gear and discussed
                        plans to use spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band to expand its fixed wireless access network. AT&amp;T said it would use Samsung’s CBRS-compliant radios and base station equipment, and tap CommScope as the Spectrum Access System (SAS)
                        provider. In Kodali’s post, he emphasized that operators can add new radios to existing cellular sites to deliver wireless broadband more cost effectively than by using a cable or fiber approach. Kodali noted those options can
                        pose a challenge in many underserved areas because of the cost and time associated with getting access to right-of-ways and needing to dig to lay down new cables or fiber. Samsung’s first FCC-certified CBRS unit was delivered in
                        July 2019 and the vendor said CBRS solutions are operating in multiple rural U.S. markets. In addition to the Massive MIMO unit, Samsung's CBRS solutions include strand, and pole or wall mount 2W small cells, and 20W Remote Radio
                        Head. The initial focus is on multi-carrier LTE, but Samsung’s CBRS equipment can be upgraded to 5G New Radio (NR). Beamforming massive MIMO antenna technology enables a single radio to provide broadband to several households and
                        businesses, Kodali noted. The CBRS gear leverages the maximum Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW) and Occupied Bandwidth (OBW) specifications, which Kodali’s blog said reduces operators’ hardware investments for deploying CBRS networks
                        by maximizing cell capacity and coverage.&nbsp;IBW is the spectrum bandwidth range a system can operate in and for OBW, a system can '"transmit" the specified bandwidht in MHz, Samsung Networks'&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek Johnston, head
                        of marketing and 5G business development explained. “Specifically, Samsung’s 64T64R CBRS Massive MIMO radio, now commercially available, can operate over the entire CBRS spectrum with an IBW of 150MHz,” wrote Kodali. “The massive
                        MIMO unit can simultaneously transmit up to 100MHz of OBW, with a combination of 10 and 20MHz carriers (or spectrum bandwidth) across the entire CBRS Band.” An operator isn't always able to place the spectrum bandwidth next to
                        each other "so having a wide IBW gives them flexibility to place each carrier anywhere within&nbsp;the full CBRS spectrum band," Johnston said via email to Fierce, noting the vendor's MMU can transmit the maximum allocated bandwidth,
                        which Samsung believes is "un-matched in terms of commercial solution availability." Aside from fixed wireless, operators might also be looking at the 3.5 GHz band to fill in mobile coverage gaps or boost capacity, which Samsung
                        said can be cost efficient with massive MIMO. Samsung already has a foothold in next-gen networks in the U.S., supporting both AT&amp;T and Verizon’s 5G rollouts.&nbsp;It has also deployed “tens of thousands of mid-band Massive
                        MIMO radios” in South Korea, which Kodali suggested gives Samsung proven experience for commercial deployments looking ahead in the C-band. “Samsung is already innovating in this area, including built-in flexibility to drive commercial
                        mid-band solutions and develop new products supporting C-Band (3.7-3.98GHz),” Kodali wrote. In second quarter earnings released Thursday, Samsung noted 5G investments both in South Korea and abroad were delayed due to COVID-19
                        pandemic. For the second half of 2020 outlook for Networks division Samsung said: "Despite uncertainties such as changes in 5G investment timelines by operators, continue to explore new opportunities to secure a foundation for
                        growth." The FCC’s much anticipated C-band auction is slated to kick off in December, offering 280 MHz of key mid-band spectrum for 5G. At this point, most 5G deployments in the U.S. have either used millimeter wave or low-band
                        frequencies, and mid-band resources for 5G have been scarce. T-Mobile is the exception and actively working to turn on a deep pool of 2.5 GHz spectrum previously held by Sprint before the two carriers merged in April. Notably,
                        T-Mobile is the only nationwide carrier that hasn’t tapped Samsung for 5G equipment, at this point using Nokia and Ericsson as its main suppliers. Samsung was one of Sprint’s three 5G vendors for its initial (now deactivated) 5G
                        network.

                        <h5>The Samsung 64T64R CBRS Massive MIMO radio operates over the entire CBRS spectrum with an IBW of 150MHz</h5> Samsung delivered its first Federal Communication Commission-certified, 5G-ready CBRS massive MIMO solution in July of
                        2019. The solution, based on the 3GPP Release 15 standard, is capable of delivering fixed wireless access internet service to rural and suburban areas, which are notorious hard to cover due to challenging topography and geographical
                        constraints. Samsung has now announced that it is expanded the commercial availability of its CBRS network solution to further close the connectivity gap, citing the “new normal” of working and learning from home as an additional
                        motivator behind the expansion. In a blog on the Samsung website, Sanjay Kodali, head of customer technology solutions, Networks Division, Samsung Electronics America wrote that CBRS can provide a solution for those communities
                        still being left out when it comes to adequate connectivity. “After launching late last year with Samsung CBRS solutions in use across multiple rural U.S. markets,” Kodali wrote, “the company has expanded the commercial availability
                        of its CBRS solutions to all mobile operators. Samsung’s CBRS solutions in the mid-band 3.5 GHz spectrum are now providing operators with a fixed wireless access approach for rural areas to deliver service from a cell site to otherwise
                        hard-to-reach homes and businesses.” He also said that by leveraging their existing cellular sites, operators can add new radios to deliver wireless internet services, offering a more cost-effective approach than cable or fiber-based
                        solutions, which can be more time-consuming and costly. Specifically, Samsung’s CBRS solution leverages the maximum Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW) and Occupied Bandwidth (OBW) specifications, which, according to Kodali<em>,&nbsp;</em>improves
                        flexibility and reduces hardware investments. Further, the company’s 64T64R CBRS Massive MIMO radio operates over the entire CBRS spectrum with an IBW of 150 megahertz. The massive MIMO unit can simultaneously transmit up to 100
                        megahertz of OBW, with a combination of 10 and 20-megahertz carriers or spectrum bandwidth across the entire CBRS band. “Through use of IBW and OBW, Samsung’s 64T64R solution maximizes cell capacity and coverage to help operators
                        reach more homes and businesses, while improving service levels,” he wrote.

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">Just 11 days after it began, Auction 105 of spectrum in the CBRS band has already raised $1 billion, suggesting that ultimate auction proceeds will be on the high side of what pundits had estimated, or could even exceed most estimates.
                        The numbers reflect the attractiveness of mid-frequency, or mid-band, spectrum. The band, which lies between 3550 and 3700 MHz – is high enough to support fast speeds but low enough to provide coverage without the extra time and
                        money investment required to densify cellsite infrastructure. Estimates for how much the CBRS auction&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/many-have-hopes-pinned-on-cbrs-auction-start-date-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would raise</a>&nbsp;ranged
                        from as low as $3 billion to $4 billion to around $10 billion. On opening day, auction proceeds reportedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.multichannel.com/news/cbrs-auction-blows-by-spectrum-reserve-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surpassed</a>&nbsp;the
                        reserve price and the pace has not slowed. If the current pace continues — and considering that the auction is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/qualified-cbrs-auction-bidders-total-271-including-numerous-rural-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projected to last</a>&nbsp;at least two months — the early results suggest that the final number could hit or exceed the high estimate. All major U.S. wireless companies&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cox-frontier-cable-one-windstream-consolidated-others-join-major-wireless-carriers-as-cbrs-5g-auction-bidders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified to bid</a>&nbsp;in the auction, along with cable companies such as Cox, tier 2 telecom providers such as Frontier and Windstream, numerous smaller carriers and others. Companies
                        such as Frontier and Windstream are likely to use any winnings to provide fixed wireless service as a lower-cost alternative to fiber-based broadband.

Adding to the attractiveness of the CBRS band is that about half the band is available for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/fcc-authorizes-cbrs-full-commercial-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlicensed use</a>, enabling companies that win spectrum to easily augment their holdings.

                            </figcaption>
                        </figure> Though it’s been in the news quite a bit lately, one of the more interesting offerings to come from the wireless industry isn’t actually new at all. CBRS, or Citizens Broadband Radio Services, is a 150 MHz chunk of radio frequency
                        (RF) spectrum in the very precious mid-band (roughly 3.5 GHz) portion of the cellular wireless network world that the FCC (US Federal Communications Commission) started developing 10 years ago. Only recently, however, is it starting
                        to show off the benefits it was designed to enable when it was first conceived—both in terms of companies being able to access it and products that make it work. Over the last few weeks, the US government has started public auctions
                        to provide access to a portion of the 3.55 GHz-3.7 GHz frequencies (sometimes called band 48) that make up the CBRS block. As expected, big carriers like AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon have been actively involved in the multi-week-long
                        bid process, but so have large companies and institutions, including Duke University and Health System, Chevron, and San Diego Gas and Electric among others. In fact, 271 organizations are bidding for the 22,631 county-sized licenses
                        available across the US and have already generated over $1.5 billion in bids (total numbers are expected to hit mid-single digit billions when it’s all done). The reason for the interest is that CBRS is an interesting new opportunity
                        that many believe could provide a path forward for creating new types of wireless services and a new means for private companies to create their own wireless networks. It’s also the first of what are expected to be several forthcoming
                        experiments in sharing RF spectrum in clever ways. Typically, spectrum is either licensed—as is the case with cellular networks, for which companies like AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon pay to own exclusive access—or spectrum is
                        unlicensed, as is the case with WiFi, for which anyone can use the same frequencies at the same time. As you can imagine, there are many benefits and downsides to each approach in terms of cost, quality of service, reach, etc.
                        At its core, CBRS is essentially a semi-licensed model. While there are a lot of details behind exactly how it works (see “<a class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/03/24/spectrum-sharing-technologies-like-cbrs-key-to-more-robust-wireless-networks/" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/03/24/spectrum-sharing-technologies-like-cbrs-key-to-more-robust-wireless-networks/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/03/24/spectrum-sharing-technologies-like-cbrs-key-to-more-robust-wireless-networks/" aria-label="Spectrum-Sharing Technologies Like CBRS Key To More Robust Wireless Networks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum-Sharing Technologies Like CBRS Key To More Robust Wireless Networks</a>” for more details), what that
                        means is CBRS is uniquely designed to meet the needs of several interested parties at the same time, including the US Department of Defense, private businesses and wireless carriers, among others. By itself, that’s interesting,
                        but throw in the fact that it’s in a highly coveted range of frequencies and, well, let’s just say lots of people are interested in getting involved. In addition to having access to the frequencies, however, you need to have network
                        equipment that’s designed to work on those frequencies and in the manner that CBRS was uniquely designed to do. That’s where network equipment providers, such as Samsung Networks, come into play. Though they’ve been a bit hidden
                        in the background against larger telco equipment providers like Ericsson and Nokia, the recent controversies around Huawei have suddenly thrust Samsung’s network division into the spotlight in the US. (FYI, Samsung is the largest
                        network equipment provider in its home country of South Korea, which currently has some of the most advanced 5G networks in the world.) The company has announced huge wins with all the major US carriers, and last year it announced
                        an arrangement with AT&amp;T to help deliver broadband services over cellular networks—a capability called Fixed Wireless Access (FWA)—using CBRS in several rural areas. This past week, the company announced expanded availability
                        for its CBRS solutions to all major network carriers, with a specific focus on fixed wireless. To understand how it all works and why it all matters, it’s important to take a step back. First, because of where it sits in the overall
                        frequency spectrum, as well as the width of the channels (or data lanes) available in its frequency range, it turns out that one of the more compelling capabilities that CBRS can bring to big carriers is wireless broadband service.
                        In all regions where CBRS service is available, 80 MHz of the spectrum is unlicensed, meaning anyone can use it. Priority Access Licenses, or PALs, are available for the other 70 MHz in seven 10 MHz chunks, with no company being
                        able to license more than four of them (for a total of 40 MHz) per county. (The current CBRS auctions mentioned earlier are for these PALs.) What that means is that a carrier (or any other entity), could theoretically use up to
                        120 MHz of spectrum (40 via PAL licenses and 80 unlicensed) to create a wireless service in a given county in the US. Real-world translation? Up to 100 Mbps download speeds and just over 10 Mbps upload speeds—a respectable offering
                        no matter where you live, but a truly magnificent leap from the 5-10 Mbps download speeds that many people who live in rural areas have to suffer through (if they even get broadband service at all). Given the incredibly important
                        role that broadband now plays in our work, school, and home lives—especially in our current pandemic-dominated world—that’s a critically important boost. The way Samsung is achieving this is via a massive MIMO (Multiple Input,
                        Multiple Output) antenna array and beamforming technology that supports 64 separate transmitters and receivers on a single tower. In addition, because there’s no way of knowing exactly which 10 MHz channels any given carrier may
                        win in the auction, the system can support up to 100 MHz of spectrum (split into ten 10 MHz channels or five 20 MHz channels or any combination thereof) across any section of the 150 MHz that’s available. Just to keep matters confusing,
                        as the telecom industry seemingly loves to do, this is described as having the potential to simultaneously transmit 100 MHz of Occupied Bandwidth (OBW) out of the 150 MHz of Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW) that makes up the complete
                        CBRS range. (Seriously, who comes up with this stuff?!) As with other FWA services, at the customer end, you need to install a small antenna-based receiving device with line-of-sight visibility to the tower. Realistically, that
                        means installing on the roof of a house or apartment, and then connecting a router-type device via an Ethernet of fiber optic cable. Early reports suggest that homes up to a mile away from the transmitting tower can receive the
                        signal, making it a significantly less expensive solution for carriers to deploy to multiple houses (thanks to the numerous transmitters) in rural areas. Because CBRS was started so long ago, it was initially conceived as a 4G
                        LTE-based solution, and early iterations of it are still 4G. Luckily, standards developments have been made over time and virtually all the CBRS equipment that’s starting to be deployed—including these new Samsung Networks transmitters—are
                        software-upgradable to enable 5G support. As a result, CBRS-powered services (which may also use the OnGo brand to clarify what they are) will soon become synonymous with 5G. The release later this year of more mid-band RF spectrum
                        for 5G use in the nearby 3.7 GHz range (often called “C Band”) will undoubtedly complicate matters a bit (see “<a class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/02/27/cbrs-vs-c-band-making-sense-of-mid-band-5g/" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/02/27/cbrs-vs-c-band-making-sense-of-mid-band-5g/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobodonnell/2020/02/27/cbrs-vs-c-band-making-sense-of-mid-band-5g/" aria-label="CBRS Vs. C-Band: Making Sense Of Mid-Band 5G" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBRS Vs. C-Band: Making Sense Of Mid-Band 5G</a>” for more), but for now, it’s great to see progress being made toward improving rural broadband.
                        In addition, it’s interesting to see how Samsung is continuing to expand its telco network presence here in the US. For a company that most people only think makes phones and TVs, that’s a big leap forward. <strong>Disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;<em>TECHnalysis Research is a tech industry market research and consulting firm and, like all companies in that field, works with many technology vendors as clients, some of whom may be listed in this article.</em>

                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">August 5, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Kelly Hill</span>
                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">A little more than a year ago, Federated Wireless announced that the network of sensors that it had built out along the nation’s coastlines was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190514/network-infrastructure/federateds-coastal-sensor-network-is-ready-to-support-cbrs-roll-outs" data-wpel-link="internal">ready to commercially support operations</a>&nbsp;in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service shared spectrum at 3.5 GHz. That&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190731/network-infrastructure/lte/commscope-federated-google-esc" data-wpel-link="internal">Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) network</a>&nbsp;is critical to being able to support CBRS usage along the nation’s Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts, because it enables the protection of ship-mounted
                        naval radar incumbents. Federated was the first to put an ESC in operation, and Federated CTO Kurt Schaubach noted that the ESC capability enables the company to assign manage the full 150 megahertz of the CBRS band in most locations
                        across the country, including the often highly-populated coastal protection zones. “Without an ESC, you can’t effectively provide full access to PALs across all of the U.S. for the users, so that’s why we think it’s been very important
                        for us to make investments in the network to jumpstart deploying and operating,” he said. (CBRS Priority Access Licenses, or PALs, are in the process of being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200805/spectrum/pals-auction-raises-1-6-billion-in-bids" data-wpel-link="internal">auctioned by the Federal Communications Commission</a>.) Federated’s ESC has about 220 sensors in operation. “These geographies are quite large, they go inland several hundred miles,” Schaubach went on.
                        “There’s a lot of population that sits underneath those areas, [where]the ESC becomes the most critical component to effective spectrum access and use.” In some areas of the U.S. with incumbent fixed satellite ground stations or
                        grandfathered WISP operations, there are only 100 megahertz available due to incumbent protections. But, Schaubach says, over time more of the spectrum will become available as the GWBLs (Grandfathered Wireless Broadband Licensees)
                        such as WISPs transition their operations from Part 90 to Part 96, and dynamic protections replace static protections for the fixed satellite stations. According to Federated execs, the company has a dominant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200721/network-infrastructure/federated-looks-ahead-to-cbrs-spectrum-secondary-market" data-wpel-link="internal">share of the CBRS small cells</a>&nbsp;that have already been deployed under the General Authorized Access — of the more than 25,000 CBRS active sites, Federated said its systems are managing around 15,000
                        of them. The ESC network is part of what has driven the company’s market position, Schaubach said. “When we designed the network, we took very much an operational mindset to it, in terms of making sure that we had redundant coverage
                        and other redundancies — like the backhaul and battery backup,” he went on. “The key thing there is that we didn’t want the impact of a site going offline — which happens, of course, that happens in any network — where you might
                        lose backhaul, a weather event like a hurricane or other storm might take a site offline. We didn’t want that to result in a lack of access to spectrum for our customers. Without redundancy, the network needs to fall back into
                        a failsafe mode … to say that if I can’t fully sense or monitor the presence of a navy radar, I have to assume that none of this spectrum is available for me to assign for customers. So basically, if you lose the capability to
                        monitor you lose the ability to assign a hundred megahertz of spectrum just like that. So we designed the network to make sure that we had multiple points of redundancy in it, so that a minor outage here or there would not have
                        an impact on the commercial use by our customers.” Today, he said, the ESC network is running at more than five-9s availability. Federated approached its ESC build-out to make the best use of site locations and other capabilities
                        available to it. “We did a lot of innovative things in terms of how we designed the ESC, to make it easy and flexible to install in a lot of diverse locations, which was important for achieving that nationwide network capability,”
                        Schaubach said. Federated also had to harden and integrate sites into a holistic network, and by late last year, the company had gone through and done a lot of optimization work to improve the ESC’s coverage and tune its performance.
                        The rapid ramp-up of CBRS site deployment since the FCC approved full commercial deployment has made it a challenge to stay ahead of customer needs, Schaubach said, so Federated is continuing to pour investments in as it scales.
                        The company is already working on a next-generation ESC sensor to further improve performance, he added. “Over the course of last year, we’ve learned a lot of things. No spectrum is perfectly clean or green-field, there were a
                        lot of issues, rogue interference sources and things we needed to clean up,” Schaubach said. Those quirks are the same thing that every network operator goes through, as they bring a new network online, he was quick to add. “We
                        were the first ones to find these problems, and went out and solved a lot of them. And we will continue, I think, to find stuff along the way, but we’ve done a tremendous amount of work to do clean-up already.” He gave one example
                        of a site that shared a location with small, beachside lobster shack eatery in Maine. The site was ideal for the ESC because it was right on the water — perfect for monitoring the presence of ship-borne radars. “But it turns out
                        that every time that they turned on the boilers [for preparing lobster], the generator that was used to run the boilers for the lobster shack created lots of RFI that was interfering with our ESC,” Schaubach said. “So we had to
                        work with the owner of the lobster shake to mitigate some of those impacts, eliminate the interference. “It’s these sort of real-world practical experiences that are really irreplaceable,” he continued. “Without having had that
                        year to really work on the network to continue to enhance it, I truly don’t think it would be in the state it is today, supporting customers the way it is today.”

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">US CBRS spectrum auction draws diverse range of applicants</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">August 6, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span></span>
                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">US Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is a set of wireless channels in the 3.55 to 3.65 GHz spectrum band that used to be reserved for the Department of Defense, the Navy and for satellite operators. Today the wireless spectrum
                        also provides much-desired licenses for telecom operators of all shapes and sizes that covet mid-band spectrum that can be used to augment existing 4G/5G networks or allow companies without mobile assets to offer wireless services.
                        On 23 July , the auction for Priority Access Licenses (PALs) for CBRS began; each PAL consists of a 10 megahertz channel in the band. Some 22,631 licenses will be offered, with seven licenses available for each US county (or census
                        tract).
                        <h3>CBRS spectrum auction is a hot ticket</h3> So far the auction has resulted in 271 qualified bidders. The applicants consist of an astounding array of companies from mobile network operators and cable companies, to wireless internet
                        service providers, electric utilities, universities, and large enterprises. They are excited about using CBRS spectrum to supplement existing networks for public or private use, or to roll out their own networks without having
                        to engage with a service provider. In either case, the auction will have a significant effect on public and private wireless networks and on the race to offer 5G. The PAL licenses provide blocks of spectrum – each applicant can
                        get up to four different 10 Mhz chunks per license area and aggregate them if they wish. PALs are 10-year renewable licenses. The fact that cable companies and non-mobile operators are bidders has been expected as these service
                        providers may want to offer their own wireless services without having to rely on a mobile operator or Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) that aggregates spectrum and resells it. So far, bidders in this segment include Charter,
                        Cable One, Cox, Shenandoah Cable, and Dish as well as Windstream, Frontier, Cincinnati Bell, CenturyLink (dba as Actel), and Docomo Pacific (in Guam). US Cellular, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile are also in the running to add
                        to their mobile assets. It is expected that these bidders will offer private and hybrid public/private LTE or eventually 5G networks to businesses, but also will improve in-building coverage for consumer services including Fixed
                        Wireless Access (FWA).
                        <h3>Is there room for everyone to make money?</h3> It is the non-operators that are of particular interest as probable do-it-yourself spectrum licensees for private networks. They include universities, large companies, and utilities
                        – including Virginia Tech, Texas A&amp;M, Duke University, Chevron, Deere and Company, Tampa Electric, Socal Edison, Alabama Power, and the City of Donalsonville. GA (which owns a utility). Many of the use cases for enterprises
                        include in-building or campus IoT applications that leverage CBRS. Followers of the private wireless network market see the potential for massive competition – even beyond what we see today, with mobile operators seeking both connectivity
                        and professional services revenue, and infrastructure providers such as Nokia and Ericsson already actively seeking incremental revenues from 4G/5G network design, build-out and management services. &nbsp; This begs the question
                        – Is there room for everyone to make money? We also already see private companies such as automotive manufacturers using their own spectrum to roll out their own wireless networks to supplement or replace WiFi and in-building wired
                        access.</div>

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">t took 11 days for CBRS auction proceeds to hit $1 billion. Yesterday, just three days later, the CBRS auction take surpassed $2 billion. Eleven days for the first billion, 3 days for the second. How long before we hit the third? The
                        CBRS auction, or FCC Auction 105, is making coveted mid-band spectrum, which lies between 3550 and 3700 MHz, available on a county wide basis. The spectrum offers a great balance between high bandwidth capability and good range.
                        As of this morning,&nbsp;<a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total auction proceeds</a>&nbsp;were $2.1 billion, with 3 additional rounds scheduled for today.
                        Estimates peg the total take for Auction 105 to be as low as $3 billion to $4 billion, up to around $10 billion. The auction could last as long as two months, so at this pace, I’d place my bet on it getting closer to or maybe exceeding
                        the high end. CBRS applications will include augmenting 4G and 5G coverage for mobile carriers, as well as powering fixed wireless service as an alternative to wired home broadband services. There are 271 qualified bidders in the
                        auction, representing the largest national wireless carriers, down to the smallest broadband cooperatives, and everything in between, including traditional cable companies. The FCC is auctioning the licensed portion of the CBRS
                        band, but an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/fcc-authorizes-cbrs-full-commercial-deployment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlicensed version</a>&nbsp;is available as well. There is also a strong interest

                            <div id="drr-container" class="cat "> The FCC's Auction 105 continues into its third week Monday, having sold off more than $2.4 billion worth of priority access to the Citizen's Broadband Radio Service since kicking off on July 23. CBRS&nbsp;is a hot topic in
                                the wireless world for several reasons, not least of which is its unique three-tiered access system that carries with it the potential for an almost endless array of new services. Enterprises can use the spectrum – which
                                sits between 3550MHz and 3700MHz – to roll their own IoT networks, MSPs can offer various services like smart buildings, and the carriers can fold it into their networks. The tiered system is what makes CBRS different from
                                other regulated spectrum in the U.S. First, there are incumbent users in this frequency band, most notably the U.S. Navy, which uses it for radar. Incumbents always take priority over other users. The second tier is Priority
                                Access, which is what Auction 105 covers. Priority Access Licenses (PAL) have to accept interference from incumbents, and must not interfere with their signals, but otherwise take priority over the third tier of users,
                                called General Authorized Access. GAA users can still use CBRS frequencies, but have to give way to signals from PAL holders and incumbents. All of this is managed by a spectrum access system, which is licensed by the FCC
                                but operated by the private sector. The SAS uses environmental sensors to detect signals in a given CBRS access area and assigns channels and prioritizes traffic based on a given user's access tier. At least in theory,
                                this ensures that any kind of CBRS user can access the spectrum without interference, subject to the rules involved. The licenses being auctioned off are 10MHz wide, and each license gives its holder priority access to
                                that piece of spectrum in a single U.S. county. Prices have ranged from $1,000 for remote, sparsely inhabited areas, up to $34 million and counting for urban cores like Los Angeles County and Chicago's Cook County. The
                                auction's structure means that it has an unusual end condition – according to the FCC, auction 105 will not end until there are no counties left in which demand for licenses exceeds total supply. Of the 3,233 counties in
                                the U.S., just 240 meet that criteria, which implies that the auction is heading into its final stages.
                                <aside id="" class="nativo-promo nativo-promo-1 smartphone"></aside>The FCC will auction off seven PALs for each of those counties, meaning that a total of 22,631 total licenses were available at the outset. PAL holders can combine up to four of them at a time for an up to 40MHz-wide
                                channel in a given county, and the licenses can be sold or traded. This last point is significant, according to Don Price, senior vice president of technology at cloud-based carrier software provider Mavenir, since at least
                                some of the 271 qualified bidders for Auction 105 may be participating with arbitrage in mind.
                                <aside id="" class="nativo-promo nativo-promo-1 tablet desktop"></aside>"I think it's a pretty clever scheme they've come up with – either use spectrum or sell it," he said. But the opportunity for enterprises and other kinds of service provider are equally compelling. "This is the
                                first time that enterprises have had the opportunity to deploy a private 5G or LTE network without the traditional dependence on [mobile carriers]," Price said. </div>

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">Activity in the FCC's ongoing auction of 3.5GHz CBRS spectrum licenses isn't playing out quite like the agency's other recent auctions. "It is unusual at this stage of an auction to have such a large difference in aggregate bidding,
                        which reflects the demand from the bidders, and gross proceeds, which represents the amount of supply that is available to meet the bidders' demands," noted Ari Meltzer and Rick Engelman with Wiley Rein, a law firm that is heavily
                        involved in telecom matters. In a statement distributed to the media, the lawyers wrote that, as of round 31, aggregate bidding in the auction reached $3.898 billion, 51% more than the auction's gross proceeds of $2.576 billion.
                        The auction won't conclude until aggregate bids and gross proceeds converge. &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        </div> &nbsp; &nbsp; "While excess demand is falling in the CBRS auction, it is doing so at a slower pace than in recent prior auctions," explained the Wall Street analysts at New Street Research in a note to investors this weekend. "With
                        excess demand lingering, particularly in large urban areas (where prices are at $0.35/MHz/POP), it seems likely aggregate bids will move higher." The MHz/POP figure is a measurement of the number of people covered compared with
                        the amount of spectrum available. The FCC's CBRS auction reached&nbsp;<a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction105">round 32 in bidding Monday morning</a>, with $2.738 billion in gross proceeds. There were 278
                        counties where bidding demand exceeded supply – a figure that some analysts noted has been falling recently. "This excess demand has been trending downward, with a 32% drop on Friday and a 40% drop on Thursday," wrote the Wall
                        Street analysts at Raymond James in a note to investors this weekend. "The aggregate bidding doesn't yet mirror that downward trend primarily because much of the excess demand is in large and expensive counties." &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        </div> &nbsp; &nbsp; Continued the Raymond James analysts: "While some of the most populated counties, such as Cook (Chicago), Harris (Houston), and Miami-Dade have reached equilibrium (i.e., demand is equal to, or less than, supply),
                        other large locations like Los Angeles, San Diego, and New York still have demand in the mid- to high-teens (vs. a supply of just seven licenses per market). We will continue to monitor Auction 105 (current average price of $0.126
                        per MHz/POP) as it has not yet entered the auction tail phase." Others, however, believe the auction is entering its end game. "The CBRS auction is rapidly entering its third and final stage," wrote analyst Frank Rayal&nbsp;
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frankrayal_cbrs-5g-activity-6697634754541559808-Ghch/">on LinkedIn</a>. "Over the past week, many large markets have settled (Chicago, Phoenix, Houston, Miami). On the other hand, Southern California is emerging as the most desirable area with the highest dollar value. Should the same
                        pace continue, the auction could wrap up next week with a total raised between $3B-$4B." Indeed, much about the CBRS auction has defied predictions.

                        from just $1.3 billion to fully $10 billion. As in past auctions, the FCC is not identifying CBRS bidders during the auction, instead only releasing information on which locations are receiving bids, and how much they're bidding.
                        The agency will keep bidding open until there are no more bids, a process that could take weeks or even months.

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">The CBRS auction bid total has now exceeded $3 billion. The fast-paced auction started just over two weeks ago, and already proceeds have exceeded the amount that some pundits expected the entire auction to raise. Just Friday we reported
                        that the auction&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-momentum-pushes-auction-proceeds-past-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had raised $2 billion</a>&nbsp;as of the previous day. And the previous&nbsp;
                        <a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-auction-proceeds-surpass-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1-billion-milestone</a>&nbsp;was hit just four days before that. CBRS spectrum is considered mid-band spectrum, which is in high demand as many industry stakeholders see it providing the optimum mixture of speed and coverage for
                        5G. <strong>CBRS Auction Bids</strong> All three major wireless carriers – AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cox-frontier-cable-one-windstream-consolidated-others-join-major-wireless-carriers-as-cbrs-5g-auction-bidders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified to bid</a>&nbsp;in the auction and so did a wide range of other entities, including smaller wireless carriers, cable companies, fixed wireless providers, wireline providers
                        looking to offer fixed wireless and more. Spectrum in the CBRS band lies between 3550-3700. About half the band is already available for unlicensed use. The remainder is included in the ongoing auction, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auction 105</a>. Seven licenses, each for 10 MHz of spectrum, are being auctioned on a county-by-county basis. The news that CBRS auction bids hit $3 billion came just one day after
                        the Department of Defense and the White House said they would make an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/fcc-will-auction-another-100-mhz-of-mid-band-spectrum-for-5g/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional 100 MHz</a>&nbsp;of
                        mid-band spectrum available for commercial use, and the FCC said it would promptly organize an auction of that spectrum. The spectrum is adjacent to the CBRS band, lying between 3450-3550 MHz, and the news of its impending
                        availability should further boost the appeal of the CBRS band, as carriers would be able to further boost speeds and capacity if they can gain spectrum in both bands.

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">Action continued Wednesday in the FCC’s auction for licenses in the shared Citizens Broadband Radio Service (<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">CBRS</a>) band, as the last several rounds saw bidders
                        turn attention to areas offering relative bargains on spectrum. At the end of round 39 this afternoon, gross proceeds stood around $3.54 billion. While demand has dropped off since earlier rounds, it still outpaced supply in 137
                        county areas. There is still one more round of results before Wednesday bidding ends. Auction 105 offers 70 MHz of priority access licenses (PALs) on a county basis across 3,233 areas, each with&nbsp;seven 10-megahertz blocks available.
                        Large counties, like Los Angeles and San Diego have garnered higher price tags so far on a per MHz-PoP basis – landing at $0.530339 and $0.683647 as of round 39, respectively, according to auction <a href="https://sashajavid.com/FCC_Auction105.php" rel="nofollow">tracking</a> by Sasha Javid, COO of BitPath. Demand in the most populous counties has dropped off since the start of the auction, and Javid noted that the focus is now on smaller counties and larger markets with
                        prices that remain <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cbrs-auction-crosses-3-billionbut-deals-remain-bidders-sasha-javid/?trackingId=E8Y%2FVEmWR4mce1Z4UtgPwA%3D%3D" rel="nofollow">relatively cheap</a>. “The last few rounds
                        have been a period of bargain hunting,” Javid told Fierce after Tuesday’s bidding closed. “Bidders have left the most expensive markets like Los Angeles and San Diego and moved into markets that remain relative bargains compared
                        to their predicted prices derived from past auctions.” RELATED: <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/cbrs-auction-surpasses-1b-threshold">CBRS auction surpasses $1B threshold</a> Five of the 20 largest counties still
                        had excess demand on Wednesday afternoon, compared to 11 at the end of round 34 on Monday. Those include Houston (Harris Texas), Phoenix (Maricopa County), Las Vegas (Clark County), Seattle (King County), and Detroit (Wayne County),
                        which maintained lower comparative prices. Javid, who was chief data officer and legal advisor for the FCC’s Incentive Auction Task Force in 2016, called out county&nbsp;areas housing Phoenix and Houston in particular, which saw
                        demand increase substantially in rounds 33 and 34 as bidders moved out of Los Angeles. “Similar story for Seattle which saw an increase in demand in round 36 as its price remained a third of its predicted price,” he told Fierce.
                        After Wednesday’s rounds, Seattle’s King County is now at 40% of its predicted price – with a price per MHz-POP of $0.164194 after Round 39. Take a look at two bubble graphs below, courtesy of Javid, to illustrate. You can find

                        is different from earlier 5G spectrum auctions in a few ways. That includes the band itself, as CBRS has a three-tier sharing set-up that encompasses federal users, PALs, and unlicensed general authorized access (GAA) users. It
                        also comes with more stringent power restrictions because of the shared nature. The county-size license areas are smaller than partial economic areas (PEAs) offered in recent auctions, and possibly enticed a wider pool of participants.
                        To that end, there are 271 qualified bidders. Comparatively, the FCC’s last 5G auction for millimeter wave spectrum had 35 qualified bidders. Mark Gibson, director of Business Development at Commscope, called the CBRS auction historic
                        for a few reasons including the most licenses ever auctioned by the FCC (22,631) and&nbsp;the most bidders ever participating. And third “it’s likely someone will be able to acquire a spectrum license for a little over $1,000,”
                        he said.&nbsp; Commscope has played a large part in CBRS efforts and is one of five certified Spectrum Access System (SAS) administrators. Gibson is a board member of the CBRS Alliance and the Wireless Innovation Forum. While large
                        counties with low prices are getting attention, he&nbsp;noted steady interest in small counties as well. “We’ll have to wait until the auction concludes to see who bid on what, but it’s still a safe bet that the auction should
                        ultimately result in putting spectrum in the hands of smaller, rural interests. There are over 20 counties with populations below 10,000 that are still in play. And there are many more where the bidding may have concluded,” Gibson
                        said in comments emailed to Fierce. Estimates have varied on how much the CBRS auction might raise, with some predicting $3 billion to as <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/cbrs-pal-auction-poised-to-be-a-doozy-possibly-raising-10b">high as $10 billion</a> for some. That said, proceeds haven’t necessarily been the star of the show, as sustained demand <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/cbrs-auction-starts-off-strong-high-demand-first-round">captured interest</a> from
                        Javid as well as analysts. In a weekend note to investors New Street Research analysts cited slowing but resilient demand after last week’s rounds. “In the last few FCC auctions for wireless spectrum, excess demand for licenses
                        has tended to fall precipitously by the twentieth round. While excess demand is falling in the CBRS auction, it is doing so at a slower pace than in recent prior auctions,” wrote the New Street team, which previously forecast the
                        auction would raise around $3 billion. RELATED:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/cbrs-auction-starts-off-strong-high-demand-first-round">CBRS auction starts off strong, with high demand in first round</a> “The
                        biggest takeaway remains that excess demand declined far more gradually than prior FCC clock auctions,” Javid told Fierce, adding he believes the size of the licenses, along with the number and diversity of bidders “definitely
                        contributed to this.”

                        </div> RELATED:&nbsp;CBRS auction tops $3.5 billion as bidders bargain hunt CommScope has been heavily involved in CBRS, and Gibson is on the board of the CBRS Alliance and the WInnForum. The company offers CBRS products but also serves
                        as a Spectrum Access System (SAS) administrator, one of five authorized by the FCC. The SAS dynamically manages CBRS spectrum sharing on an as needed basis across the band’s three tiers of access – federal incumbent operations,
                        PALs, and GAA users.
                        <h4>Leasing spectrum by blocks or geographic areas</h4> Who will win what at Auction 105 remains to be seen. Major operators are among qualified bidders, as are cable companies, smaller service providers and some enterprise entities.
                        Analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote Wednesday that cable operators Charter and Comcast are likely among the most active bidders, looking to offload MVNO traffic from deals with Verizon to lower costs. Verizon itself is expected
                        to be a major bidder for the mid-band spectrum. Outside of putting CBRS PAL licenses to their own use, the secondary market could offer options for winners as well. That’s where licensees can lease out their PAL spectrum rights
                        in their designated market areas. “We expect to it be robust,” Gibson said of the CBRS secondary market. “Based upon more than anything, the ability for [leasing] to be very lightweight.” That speaks to the less regulated or light-touch
                        leasing approach that the FCC is looking at. CBRS is already unique in in terms of the licensing scheme. The GAA portion is unlicensed with 80 MHz available and PALs are not exclusive-use licenses, so others can use the spectrum
                        if the licensee is not utilizing it at that time. RELATED:&nbsp;Enterprises could tap CBRS, leave carriers in the dust The commission is looking at light-touch leasing for CBRS probably even more so than other spectrum, Gibson
                        said, because the SAS is there to help manage it in real time. And CommScope gets the sense that parties will be able to take advantage of the secondary market soon. There, the SAS will help manage both partitioning and disaggregation.
                        The former relates to leasing portions of a winner’s market areas, while the latter is leasing portions of their CBRS spectrum blocks. For example, if a winner buys 40 MHz, but only wants to use 20 MHz, they might decide to lease
                        the remaining out. Ultimately parties could disaggregate one block, but that’s not possible yet, Gibson noted. CommScope is currently looking at the ability to subdivide and manage some of those coexistence issues. For partitioning,
                        a licensee could decide to put its own applications in the middle of a city within its PAL county, but then lease out other cities that are of interest within that county area. Through its SAS, CommScope would manage which users
                        are able to operate in the different geographic areas or spectrum blocks.
                        <h4>Options in the CBRS secondary market</h4> When it comes to the secondary market, Gibson discussed a few examples of how that might happen. One reason a winner might opt to lease out its PAL license rights is that they’re not ready
                        to use the CBRS spectrum for their own purposes yet but want to monetize it in the meantime. “You could take advantage of leasing right away, get some revenue going in your market and then as soon as you’re ready to go, take the
                        spectrum back and [use] it,” Gibson said. Another thing the SAS can enable is more granular leasing timeframes, something Gibson said CommScope believes people will be interested in taking advantage of. The SAS could potentially
                        be used to manage spectrum access at places like venues, he noted. “What they could do is lease the spectrum around stadiums in those markets to other interests, who could use [the spectrum] to manage operations in the stadium,”
                        Gibson said. The leasing period could be set to go into effect the week of the game, with license rights returned to the carrier 24 hours after the event ends. That’s not something that can be done right now with other spectrum
                        leases, as the SAS (which is unique to the shared CBRS band) can manage more time-adjusted leasing. RELATED:&nbsp;COVID-19 fuels indoor CBRS for some verticals: Special Report Another example of how the CBRS secondary market could
                        be used&nbsp;is by bidders that weren’t successful at winning contentious markets but want to deliver services on a more extended timeline. One of the highlights during ongoing auction was sustained excess demand, even in smaller
                        counties with comparatively low population counts. According to auction tracking by Sasha Javid’s BitPath, out of the 20 counties that had the largest excess demand after round 55 on Tuesday, ten had populations under 100,000 and
                        seven had under 50,000.&nbsp;Meade, Kansas, with a population of just 4,575, still had two blocks of excess demand over the supply of seven. Gibson pointed to the example of Loving County in Texas – with a population of merely
                        82 – which had nine contentions at one point. “Somebody is not going to get spectrum,” he said. So if a winner buys one channel or four but isn’t ready to put it to use, “they could turn around to one of the people who didn’t win
                        and say you bid on this, we know you did, we’ll let you lease our spectrum in our market and you can get started right away until you have other assets in place.” RELATED:&nbsp;Federated readies ‘Airbnb’ for secondary CBRS spectrum
                        market There is one minor limitation in the SAS, Gibson acknowledged, regarding required coordination with the FCC.&nbsp;CommScope is meeting with the commission early next month to finalize some coordination aspects, related to
                        data that has to flow back and forth between the SAS to manage coexistence in the band. If leasing is desired right away, it can happen but some of it would be managed outside the SAS. That said, he doesn’t see the timeline as
                        a major issue.&nbsp;If the auction were to end Friday, Gibson said there would still be at least two to three weeks before spectrum is usable as things like regulatory payments and forms are completed. “We’re looking at mid- to
                        late September anyhow, and we should have the leasing ready to go, we’re hopeful, by then,” Gibson said. As for progress in the shared band, deployments of devices known as CBSDs are already “in the low tens of thousands” spread
                        across the country. Though the overwhelming majority are devices required to transition from Part 90 to the CBRS Part 96. Still, there’s been a steady increase, not just of CBSDs, but of more and more users, Gibson said. He didn’t
                        give the exact number of CBRS customers CommScope is servicing but said it's “in the high scores” with other SAS administrators supporting many as well. “We think once the auctions are over and the interest has been demonstrated
                        and the efficacy of the SAS has been demonstrated, then more people will begin to jump on the CBRS bandwagon and take advantage of it,” Gibson added.</div> Bevin Fletcher

                        slices of CBRS spectrum are being auctioned in each county. The FCC&nbsp;<a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a>&nbsp;that there are 79 counties in which
                        demand is greater than supply, 2,158 where demand and supply are equal and 996 in which demand is less than supply. The CBRS auction proceeds passed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-auction-proceeds-surpass-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 billion</a>&nbsp;on August 3,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-momentum-pushes-auction-proceeds-past-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 billion</a>&nbsp;on
                        August 7 and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-auction-bids-cruise-past-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 billion</a>&nbsp;on August 11. The large CBRS auction proceeds may come as no surprise
                        to some. The spectrum is considered mid-band, lying between 3550 and 3700 GHz, and mid-band spectrum has a mix of speed and coverage characteristics that make it attractive to a wide array of companies and industry niches. The
                        list starts with the big three wireless carriers, all of which qualified to bid. A variety of other entities, including smaller wireless carriers, cable operators, fixed wireless providers and wireline providers also qualified.
                        The attraction of the spectrum and the related auction grew even greater on August 10 when the Department of Defense&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/fcc-will-auction-another-100-mhz-of-mid-band-spectrum-for-5g/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;that 100 MHz of complementary mid-band spectrum between 3.45 GHz and 3.55 GHz will be made available for commercial use. The spectrum reportedly could be available for commercial use by the
                        middle of 2022. CBRS certainly is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/many-have-hopes-pinned-on-cbrs-auction-start-date-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the place to be</a>. Verizon could particularly
                        be interested because it is light in mid-band holdings. Other firms, such as Windstream and Frontier, also have a lot to gain. They could use the spectrum to support fixed wireless, which offers fiber-like speeds but at far lower
                        deployment costs.</div> Carl Weinschenk

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">Bidding in the FCC's auction of 3.5GHz spectrum licenses appears to be easing, leading a number of industry watchers to conclude that the event may well be winding down. "Bidding has started to slow substantially," wrote the Wall Street
                        analysts at Raymond James in a note to investors this weekend. "It appears to be entering the tail phase, that usually entails (pun intended) many rounds of low incremental bids until the FCC accelerates the pace of rounds to flush
                        out all remaining bidding and eligibility and we can write the final tale on this auction."

                        </div> The FCC is now holding four bidding rounds per day, according to&nbsp;Ari Meltzer and Rick Engelman with Wiley Rein, a law firm that is heavily involved in telecom matters. The FCC generally increases the number of bidding rounds
                        per day during spectrum auctions as bidding slows, in order to bring such events to a quick close. After 50 rounds of bidding on Monday, the FCC's CBRS spectrum auction&nbsp;has raised&nbsp;a grand total of $4.3 billion in gross
                        proceeds. The event is important because CBRS spectrum could be used for&nbsp;a wide variety of services, including adding capacity to 4G and 5G networks, fixed wireless offerings in urban or rural areas, smart city applications
                        or other services. "While gross proceeds have increased substantially this week, growing $1.6BN (up 64% from last Friday) to $4.2BN, aggregate bids have stabilized, growing only 11% (or $0.4BN since last Friday) to $4.3BN," wrote
                        the Wall Street analysts at New Street Research in a note to investors this weekend. "Aggregate bids exceed gross proceeds by only $123,000, the smallest at any point in the auction." The auction will conclude when aggregate bids
                        and gross proceeds converge. The New Street analysts wrote that the auction recently reached an average of $0.20 per MHz/POP, which they acknowledged is meaningfully above their baseline forecast for the event. The MHz/POP figure
                        is a measurement of the number of people covered compared with the amount of spectrum available. "Earlier this week, as prices in large urban areas, like New York and LA, approached or exceeded $0.5 per MHz/POP, demand fell sharply
                        as bidders pulled out of those markets," the analysts wrote, noting that spectrum license prices in such valuable locations may be reaching the ceiling of what most bidders can afford. &nbsp;

                        </div> While the end may be in sight for the CBRS auction, the event certainly has defied predictions. For example,&nbsp;estimates on the total amount of money it would raise&nbsp;ranged from just $1.3 billion to fully $10 billion. As
                        in past auctions, the FCC is not identifying CBRS bidders during the auction, and is instead only releasing information on which locations are receiving bids and how much they're going for. The agency will keep bidding open until
                        there are no more bids, a process that could take weeks or even months. Many industry watchers expect&nbsp;Verizon to walk away with the bulk of the 22,631 CBRS spectrum licenses&nbsp;up for grabs.</div> Mike Dano

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">The FCC’s auction for 70 MHz of priority access licenses (PALs) in the shared CBRS band is winding down and when it’s over some might decide to take advantage of the CBRS secondary market.
                        <div id="content-embed-one-wrapper">
                            <div id="content-embed-one">There were 57 rounds completed in Auction 105 at midday Wednesday with $4.5 billion in gross proceeds.</div>
                        </div> With 271 qualified bidders in the PAL auction and 80 MHz of CBRS spectrum already available for unlicensed General Authorized Access (GAA), winners can put licenses to use in a variety of ways.
                        <div id="mobile-ad-wrapper">
                            <div id="ad-slot_1__mobile">Mark Gibson, director of business development at CommScope, told FierceWireless that he thinks Auction 105 is likely to wrap up by the end of this week.</div>
                        </div> RELATED:&nbsp;CBRS auction tops $3.5 billion as bidders bargain hunt CommScope has been heavily involved in CBRS, and Gibson is on the board of the CBRS Alliance and the WInnForum. The company offers CBRS products but also serves
                        as a Spectrum Access System (SAS) administrator, one of five authorized by the FCC. The SAS dynamically manages CBRS spectrum sharing on an as needed basis across the band’s three tiers of access – federal incumbent operations,
                        PALs, and GAA users.
                        <h4>Leasing spectrum by blocks or geographic areas</h4> Who will win what at Auction 105 remains to be seen. Major operators are among qualified bidders, as are cable companies, smaller service providers and some enterprise entities.
                        Analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote Wednesday that cable operators Charter and Comcast are likely among the most active bidders, looking to offload MVNO traffic from deals with Verizon to lower costs. Verizon itself is expected
                        to be a major bidder for the mid-band spectrum. Outside of putting CBRS PAL licenses to their own use, the secondary market could offer options for winners as well. That’s where licensees can lease out their PAL spectrum rights
                        in their designated market areas. “We expect to it be robust,” Gibson said of the CBRS secondary market. “Based upon more than anything, the ability for [leasing] to be very lightweight.” That speaks to the less regulated or light-touch
                        leasing approach that the FCC is looking at. CBRS is already unique in in terms of the licensing scheme. The GAA portion is unlicensed with 80 MHz available and PALs are not exclusive-use licenses, so others can use the spectrum
                        if the licensee is not utilizing it at that time. RELATED:&nbsp;Enterprises could tap CBRS, leave carriers in the dust The commission is looking at light-touch leasing for CBRS probably even more so than other spectrum, Gibson
                        said, because the SAS is there to help manage it in real time. And CommScope gets the sense that parties will be able to take advantage of the secondary market soon. There, the SAS will help manage both partitioning and disaggregation.
                        The former relates to leasing portions of a winner’s market areas, while the latter is leasing portions of their CBRS spectrum blocks. For example, if a winner buys 40 MHz, but only wants to use 20 MHz, they might decide to lease
                        the remaining out. Ultimately parties could disaggregate one block, but that’s not possible yet, Gibson noted. CommScope is currently looking at the ability to subdivide and manage some of those coexistence issues. For partitioning,
                        a licensee could decide to put its own applications in the middle of a city within its PAL county, but then lease out other cities that are of interest within that county area. Through its SAS, CommScope would manage which users
                        are able to operate in the different geographic areas or spectrum blocks.
                        <h4>Options in the CBRS secondary market</h4> When it comes to the secondary market, Gibson discussed a few examples of how that might happen. One reason a winner might opt to lease out its PAL license rights is that they’re not ready
                        to use the CBRS spectrum for their own purposes yet but want to monetize it in the meantime. “You could take advantage of leasing right away, get some revenue going in your market and then as soon as you’re ready to go, take the
                        spectrum back and [use] it,” Gibson said. Another thing the SAS can enable is more granular leasing timeframes, something Gibson said CommScope believes people will be interested in taking advantage of. The SAS could potentially
                        be used to manage spectrum access at places like venues, he noted. “What they could do is lease the spectrum around stadiums in those markets to other interests, who could use [the spectrum] to manage operations in the stadium,”
                        Gibson said. The leasing period could be set to go into effect the week of the game, with license rights returned to the carrier 24 hours after the event ends. That’s not something that can be done right now with other spectrum
                        leases, as the SAS (which is unique to the shared CBRS band) can manage more time-adjusted leasing. RELATED:&nbsp;COVID-19 fuels indoor CBRS for some verticals: Special Report Another example of how the CBRS secondary market could
                        be used&nbsp;is by bidders that weren’t successful at winning contentious markets but want to deliver services on a more extended timeline. One of the highlights during ongoing auction was sustained excess demand, even in smaller
                        counties with comparatively low population counts. According to auction tracking by Sasha Javid’s BitPath, out of the 20 counties that had the largest excess demand after round 55 on Tuesday, ten had populations under 100,000 and
                        seven had under 50,000.&nbsp;Meade, Kansas, with a population of just 4,575, still had two blocks of excess demand over the supply of seven. Gibson pointed to the example of Loving County in Texas – with a population of merely
                        82 – which had nine contentions at one point. “Somebody is not going to get spectrum,” he said. So if a winner buys one channel or four but isn’t ready to put it to use, “they could turn around to one of the people who didn’t win
                        and say you bid on this, we know you did, we’ll let you lease our spectrum in our market and you can get started right away until you have other assets in place.” RELATED:&nbsp;Federated readies ‘Airbnb’ for secondary CBRS spectrum
                        market There is one minor limitation in the SAS, Gibson acknowledged, regarding required coordination with the FCC.&nbsp;CommScope is meeting with the commission early next month to finalize some coordination aspects, related to
                        data that has to flow back and forth between the SAS to manage coexistence in the band. If leasing is desired right away, it can happen but some of it would be managed outside the SAS. That said, he doesn’t see the timeline as
                        a major issue.&nbsp;If the auction were to end Friday, Gibson said there would still be at least two to three weeks before spectrum is usable as things like regulatory payments and forms are completed. “We’re looking at mid- to
                        late September anyhow, and we should have the leasing ready to go, we’re hopeful, by then,” Gibson said. As for progress in the shared band, deployments of devices known as CBSDs are already “in the low tens of thousands” spread
                        across the country. Though the overwhelming majority are devices required to transition from Part 90 to the CBRS Part 96. Still, there’s been a steady increase, not just of CBSDs, but of more and more users, Gibson said. He didn’t
                        give the exact number of CBRS customers CommScope is servicing but said it's “in the high scores” with other SAS administrators supporting many as well. “We think once the auctions are over and the interest has been demonstrated
                        and the efficacy of the SAS has been demonstrated, then more people will begin to jump on the CBRS bandwagon and take advantage of it,” Gibson added.</div> Bevin Fletcher

                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">August 19, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Joan Engebretson</span>
                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">The CBRS spectrum auction has now raised $4.5 billion but the pace of increase has slowed as winning CBRS auction bids in many key counties have been determined. As of late this afternoon, there were only 49 counties in which demand
                        for licenses exceeded supply — only about 1.5 % of the 3233 counties nationwide. The CBRS band includes spectrum between 3550-3700 MHz, 70 MHz of which is being auctioned. Seven licenses, each for 10 MHz of spectrum, are available
                        for each county. As of late this afternoon, according to the FCC, there were 839 counties in which supply exceeded demand, meaning that the commission received bids for less than seven licenses. In contrast, there were 2,345 counties
                        in which demand and supply were equal. In the latter group, there may initially have been demand for more than seven licenses, but as auction rounds continued and prices climbed, some bidders dropped out or dropped the number of
                        licenses requested until a balance was reached. <strong>CBRS Auction Bids</strong> More than 270 companies&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/qualified-cbrs-auction-bidders-total-271-including-numerous-rural-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified to bid</a>&nbsp;in the auction, including all major mobile carriers, as well as many smaller ones, along with cable companies, fixed wireless providers and wireline telcos planning
                        to deploy fixed wireless service. CBRS spectrum is considered mid-band, which many stakeholders view as offering the optimum mix of range and bandwidth. Not surprisingly, the auction got off to a strong start, surpassing the reserve
                        price (the total of all minimum acceptable bids) on the first day and raising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-auction-proceeds-surpass-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 billion</a>&nbsp;within
                        11 days (or eight bidding days) after it began. It took only three more bidding days for auction proceeds to hit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-momentum-pushes-auction-proceeds-past-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 billion</a>, two bidding days after that to hit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-auction-bids-cruise-past-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 billion</a>&nbsp;and
                        another four bidding days to hit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/cbrs-auction-proceeds-hit-4-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 billion</a>. It has taken three more days to hit just $4.5 billion,
                        however. According to an informational website operated by Sasha Javid, chief operating officer for spectrum consortium Spectrum Co, LLC, the price per megahertz pop has ranged from $0.20 to $0.91 in the nation’s top 20 counties
                        by population. All but one of these counties (Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago and some suburbs) had equal supply and demand as of late this afternoon. Additional information about CBRS auction bids can be found on

                        a gross proceeds total of $4,580,094,931. But that total had only grown by a few million dollars per round over the last several rounds. After round 66, there only 14 counties with more demand for spectrum licenses than supply.
                        The FCC is auctioning 70 MHz worth of county-based Priority Access Licenses (PALs) — a whopping 22,631 of them in the 3550-3650 MHz 93.5 GHz band. That is the most-ever flexible use licenses mae available in a single auction, the
                        FCC said. Each license will be a 10 MHz unpaired channel. The auction is intended "to further deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other advanced spectrum-based services in the United
                        States." The FCC set a reserve price on the spectrum at $107,991,840, which was met in round one. Pre-auction estimates for total auction proceeds ranged from about $2 billion to as much as $10 billion. Mark Gibson, director, business
                        development, at CommScope, and a board member of the CBRS Alliance and Wireless Innovation Forum, calls the auction historic for a number of reasons. "First, this is the most licenses ever auctioned by the FCC at 22,631. Second,
                        this is the most bidders ever participating in an FCC auction at 271. Third, it’s likely someone will be able to acquire a spectrum license for a little over $1,000. Another notable point is that there is steady interest in small
                        counties." He said he thinks the auction will wind up putting some spectrum in the hands of smaller, rural interests, which is one of the FCC's goals.</div> JOHN EGGERTON

                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">Until the FCC releases the names of the winning bidders in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">CBRS</a>) 3.5 GHz auction, it’s all a guessing game, although it's
                        a safe bet to say Verizon was an aggressive participant.
                        <div id="content-embed-one-wrapper">
                            <div id="content-embed-one">Analysts at LightShed Partners are putting a number on it, saying they believe Verizon was “highly incentivized” to buy 40 MHz of CBRS spectrum in the auction that concluded on Tuesday.</div>
                        </div> Verizon has been pinning much of its 5G strategy on millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum, which means it’s mostly targeting dense areas of major metro areas. It will use dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) for a lower-band 5G spectrum
                        layer, but where it’s most deficient is in mid-band, which T-Mobile just acquired a bunch of with its Sprint merger. “A 40 MHz CBRS spectrum purchase by Verizon would understandably fuel questions about the role of mmWave spectrum
                        in Verizon’s network,”&nbsp;<a href="https://lightshedtmt.com/2020/08/26/did-verizon-take-advantage-of-the-low-priced-cbrs-spectrum-auction/" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>&nbsp;LightShed analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone. “We believe
                        Verizon can use CBRS, rather than mmWave, as a primary (but not sole) source of spectrum in its small cell deployments. We believe these small cell CBRS products already exist and that Verizon has likely already begun some deployments.”
                        <div data-oembed-url="https://twitter.com/WaltLightShed/status/1298009853433184256"> Based on the auction results, they estimate a 40 MHz pseudo-nationwide purchase of CBRS spectrum by Verizon would imply high bids of ~$2.7 billion, which represents less than 1% of the wireless service revenue they expect Verizon
                            to report over the next five years.&nbsp;LightShed estimates Verizon will spend $30 billion on mid-band spectrum over the next 12 months. They also note CBRS can outperform mmWave coverage and building penetration despite its
                            power limitations. “Therefore, CBRS might offer a better solution than mmWave for Verizon’s home broadband aspirations, whether deployed on a small cell or on a macro tower in order to hit more homes,” the analysts wrote. “To
                            validate this point, CBRS appears to be suitable spectrum for its cable competitors to expand their wired footprint for home broadband applications.” The CBRS band is already open for business in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/fcc-approves-initial-commercial-deployments-cbrs">General Authorized Access</a>&nbsp;(GAA
                            <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/fcc-approves-initial-commercial-deployments-cbrs">)</a>&nbsp;portion of the band, which is unlicensed. Verizon and other companies are already using that. In fact, earlier this summer, data from RootMetrics suggested Verizon was deploying in the GAA portion of the 3.5 GHz
                            band at a faster clip than prior to COVID-19. The LightShed analysts said that based on data provided by Opensignal and field engineers, they believe Verizon has been deploying CBRS spectrum on macro towers. They also noted
                            that in capacity constrained areas, Verizon’s ability to access the shared GAA CBRS spectrum could be challenging. The auction that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/cbrs-3-5-ghz-auction-concludes-raising-4-58b">ended this week</a>&nbsp;involved
                            the Priority Access Licenses (PAL). Qualified participants included Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, as well as cable rivals, universities and enterprises like Chevron and Deere &amp; Company, but the FCC didn’t release
                            the names of the actual winners. That’s supposed to happen in a few days, the FCC said on Tuesday. The next big opportunity for buying mid-band spectrum licenses for 5G is the C-band auction, which starts in December and
                            offers up more spectrum that’s considered less encumbered than the CBRS spectrum. The LightShed analysts said 60-100 MHz of incremental spectrum depth from the C-band auction would enable legitimate standalone 5G network
                            performance, but it doesn’t provide Verizon with the depth of spectrum that T-Mobile controls. “In addition, C-Band is higher up on the spectrum chart, which could challenge the speed and cost of its 5G buildout,” they
                            said. “Most importantly, Verizon services 120 million wireless customers with near 60% margins and plans to attack the $50 billion home broadband market. There is no company that can better leverage incremental spectrum
                            purchases,” they added. “For these reasons we believe 40 MHz is the right amount for Verizon to purchase and we will be incrementally concerned if AT&amp;T and T-Mobile captured a portion of that at these auction prices.”

                        <h4>Featuring Connectivity Wireless’ VP of Project Management, Mark Power</h4> <strong>INTERVIEWEE:</strong>&nbsp;Mark Power, Vice President of Project Management at&nbsp;<a href="https://connectivitywireless.com/?utm_source=Connected_RE&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Mark%20Power_Planning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Connectivity Wireless</a> <strong>TOPIC:</strong>&nbsp;Why planning is critical to the success of wireless system deployments
                        <h3>1. What is one thing you really wish property owners knew about successfully planning in-building wireless systems (IBW)?</h3> <strong>It will take some time and coordination, but your early involvement during the discovery and planning phases can expedite the entire deployment process.</strong> Gaining consensus on technologies, equipment locations, pathways and aesthetics takes time and iteration. Depending upon the technologies your system will include – Wi-Fi, public safety, private CBRS, or DAS – a host of potential
                        stakeholders will need to provide input into the design and overall project. Further, different funding models add a layer of complexity that affects which stakeholders will be involved in the process. Getting from discovery to
                        project kick off can sometimes take longer than the construction phase. You can make the process go more efficiently simply by being actively involved from the beginning and making sure the right departments and those with the
                        authority to support the efforts are included in the planning phase. Once the right planning process is completed, the construction phase will go much smoother. Where the property owner or manager can have the most influence in
                        maintaining the overall project timeline, without it affecting everyone’s bottom line, is during this essential planning phase.
                        <h3>2. What advice do you have for building management or owners to make the planning process go as smoothly as possible?</h3> <strong>Having an experienced and specialized project manager for your IBW system deployment can make all the difference.</strong> Because of the complexity of these projects, you should select an experienced integration partner that makes provision for a dedicated, industry-specialized project manager to oversee all tasks related to each stage in deployment
                        process, not just construction. A seasoned project manager will detail and execute plans for all phases, including discovery, engineering design, carrier approvals, owner approvals, project kick-off, communication plans, permitting,
                        materials procurement, contracting various trades, construction, inspections, system turn-up, optimization, acceptance, and close out, to name a few. Each of the stages involve complex, interdependent subsidiary tasks that need
                        to be coordinated and communicated in alignment with the overall project timeline to ensure that deadlines are met and the cost remains on budget. The more experience your project manager has with the process, technologies, and
                        the trades involved, the more cohesive these teams will work together. To drive this point home, let’s just take one point of discovery phase and see how it impacts all other aspects of the project plan: Here is a list of a few
                        of the decisions that require collaboration between building ownership and the building engineer, alone, when it comes to deciding on a location for the main equipment room (ER) to contain the Head End (HE) equipment. • Pathways
                        must be determined for the Head End ER: o To adequate AC power o To the Main Point of Entry (MPOE) for telco services o To the riser closets for the signaling cables and remotes • HVAC or ventilation needs for the ER must be reconciled.
                        Will we utilize: o A stand-alone independent HVAC system o The building’s existing chiller system o A simpler heat exchange ventilation system • Matching capacity needs with locations in the building with adequate AC power o This
                        could mean utilizing a few circuits in an existing switch panel to the rare scenario of bringing in new service from the power company; meaning yet another party to coordinate with. Again, this is just one project task, albeit
                        an important one, where a diverse set of stakeholders, including the building manager the building engineer, and the building’s architect if a new building, and potentially the owner, should be involved in any of the above decisions.
                        You can see how complicated the process quickly becomes assuming that there are several phases, each involving interdependent tasks, subtasks and multiple stakeholders. Any oversight or delay in a single task can potentially impact
                        the timeframe for the overall project plan. A good project manager will address potential problems and deliver solutions. Their aim should be to lighten the burden on the customer by guiding them through critical decisions and
                        helping them make the best choices to align with their business needs today without sacrificing their long-term wireless goals. All of this to say, any (experienced) integration partner you choose to work with should provision
                        for a dedicated, industry-specialized project manager as part of a sound deployment plan.
                        <h3>3. How will the increasing interconnection of wireless systems over the next 5-10 years impact the planning process for property owners?</h3> <strong>Property owners will not see a big change in the process of planning wireless systems, what will change for property owners is the number of stakeholders and opportunities to create value for tenants and visitors.</strong> The planning and successful deployment of new technologies will require a deeper level of experience with new technologies and how to integrate them most efficiently. A good wireless integrator and project management team will
                        know how to ask the right questions, serve as subject matter experts, and minimize the iterations to develop an executable solution and facilitate its completion. Some common examples of these newer technologies include 5G nodes,
                        parking occupancy monitoring, robotic cleaning machines, and automated building controls. As we see these commonly adopted among most industries over the next 5-10 years, new discovery questions and checkpoints, that have not previously
                        been applicable, will become critical. For example: We had one customer who had Wi-Fi in their parking garage. A parking app company approached them with a digital solution for cloud-based transactions using sensor technology.
                        Because sensitive information, credit cards, etc., was being transferred over the network, Wi-Fi in this case was not the best solution due to the lack of encryption and security; LTE was the preferred technology. But the customer’s
                        capital was already spent on the Wi-Fi, so they were unable to adopt the parking app solution. As systems become more interdependent, it will become increasingly more important for customers to make these types of decisions on
                        the front end of any wireless infrastructure or technology investment. Here is another example of a simple question that was previously irrelevant: Do I need wireless coverage in storage closets? To date, the answer for the majority
                        of properties is no, but as self-automated and digital devices become main stream in facility operations, this will change. We have a customer who adopted a digital ticketing system. The scanners were kept in a storage closet to
                        charge overnight and because the devices processed software updates when charging, they needed dependable internet connectivity. Robotic cleaning systems are another such driver for extending wireless coverage to previously unprioritized
                        spaces, like storage closets. In essence, the planning and discovery questions at the front-end of any project will be the most impactful phase in determining the type of wireless network that you need to support your property’s
                        wireless goals in the long term as well as determine your ability to adopt new and emerging wireless-dependent devices and technologies
                        <h3>4. How long have you been in wireless?</h3> <strong>26 years.</strong> I was introduced to telecom via Fort Gordon, Georgia during my military service and got in the door with a wireless services company 26 years ago. Since then,
                        I spent a few years with an OEM deploying smart antennas, then started, ran and sold my own services company after nine successful years. In 2014, I joined&nbsp;<a href="https://connectivitywireless.com/?utm_source=Connected_RE&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Mark%20Power_Planning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Connectivity Wireless</a>&nbsp;and have led several groups including Deployment, Network Operations and currently Project Management.
                        <h3>5. Tell us about yourself</h3> Jacksonville, Florida is where I called home through high school. I went to college, joined the National Guard, and most importantly, found my bride while living in Lynchburg, VA for just over 10

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Verizon, Dish: What’s in their CBRS playbooks?</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 3, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span> Monica Alleven</span>

                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Now that the winners of the Citizens Broadband Radio Services (<b><a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">CBRS</a></b>) 3.5 GHz auction are known, the question turns to: What are the winners going to
                            do with their licenses?</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">The winners aren’t talking because the FCC’s rules prohibit discussing the auction until the quiet period ends, a practice that dates back to the&nbsp;1990s to prevent collusion. However, investment analysts evaluating the auction
                            results say it’s clear that Verizon went deep in the larger U.S. markets while Dish Network went far and wide, spending less than Verizon but acquiring spectrum in more markets. Charter Communications, Comcast and Cox Communications
                            rounded out the top five highest bid amounts.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Verizon’s total spend of about $1.894 billion, which represents 41% of total winnings in the auction of Priority Access Licenses (PALs), garnered 75% of licenses in large markets. Verizon played in all of the top cities, but won
                            in only 156 counties.<b></b></p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">“However, when Verizon won, it went deep, averaging 3.6 licenses per county,” wrote Cowen analysts, noting that bidders were limited to a total of four licenses per county. “Verizon spent heavily by going deep in high traffic areas.
                            Clearly the carrier is looking at CBRS as ‘capacity’ spectrum for hotspots to overlay on top of ‘coverage’ spectrum.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Of the top three U.S. carriers, Verizon holds the least amount of untapped mid-band spectrum – AT&amp;T has WCS/AWS-3 spectrum and T-Mobile has 2.5 GHz – so it was expected to go big in the PAL auction. The analysts noted that
                            the company has said it has all the resources it needs for 5G when considering refarming, spectral efficiency technologies such as beamforming, Massive MIMO, carrier aggregation and Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), as well as
                            fiber/cell splitting.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;"></p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">“To that end, if Verizon’s network performance should slip temporarily, today’s spend should help soften the blow,” the Cowen analysts wrote. “Meanwhile, Verizon has the strongest balance sheet (this $1.89B spend essentially a
                            ‘drop in the bucket’) and is primed for a massive spend in C-band, which should restore order as the #1 network (this time in the 5G era).”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>Nationwide, 40 MHz deep didn’t happen</strong></p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Last week, LightShed Partners analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone speculated that Verizon would buy a nationwide, 40 MHz deep, CBRS spectrum position for $2.7 billion. “That was way off,” the analysts&nbsp;<b><a href="https://lightshedtmt.com/2020/09/03/dishs-5g-tech-play-and-should-t-mobile-be-allowed-to-buy-c-band/">wrote</a></b>&nbsp;today.
                            “Verizon secured high bids on 40 MHz of spectrum in just 20% of the U.S. population and 30 MHz in another 26%. That means, Verizon bought nothing in more than half the United States.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">To be fair, Verizon secured deep spectrum in the big markets where it needs it the most, they added. In smaller markets, the shared General Authorized Access (GAA) CBRS spectrum might be enough to satisfy Verizon’s spectrum needs,
                            but “using unlicensed spectrum seems more like a cable strategy than a Verizon one,” they wrote. Based on the bidding results, “we believe Verizon will primarily be using CBRS for LTE capacity augmentation. We still think this
                            could include implementations in small cells and macro towers, but this was not a positive data point for tower companies.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Verizon acquired either three or four licenses in the markets where it won, averaging 35 MHz of spectrum in those markets at an average price of $0.39 per MHz POP, according to New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin. That
                            price was close to double the overall average; however, Verizon focused on large dense markets that always trade at higher prices than the average, he noted.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">“I really think that this band becomes their bridge,” said Brian Goemmer, president of AllNet Insights, in an interview. People often talk about how Verizon can use DSS and other spectrum bands, but its other bands, aside from
                            millimeter wave, already are fairly heavily used by 4G LTE, “so they really don’t have a lot of free spectrum” for 5G coverage. “This gives them something they can use immediately and carry them, hopefully, to when they can
                            win and launch C-band spectrum.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;"><strong>‘Dish was everywhere’</strong></p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">With a total of 5,492, Dish took the most counties and licenses by far. “Dish was everywhere, in the top cities but mostly in rural markets, spending just $1.15/MHz-POP,” wrote Cowen’s Colby Synesael. “When digging deeper, we see
                            that Dish’s depth was the lowest (just 1.8 licenses per county) and in the big cities, often purchased just 1 PAL. In summary, Dish spent wisely going for breadth and not depth. This was a solid strategy to in-fill nationwide
                            coverage of upper-mid-band spectrum ideal for Dish’s wholesale/enterprise IoT network.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Dish already had the “supermarket” of untapped spectrum and continues to augment its portfolio further still. “As Dish looks for strategic partners (Uber, Amazon, drones, IoT), they did themselves a favor by augmenting the portfolio
                            with CBRS,” Synesael concluded.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">At first blush, CBRS further deepens Dish’s already robust and vacant mid-band spectrum position, according to the LightShed analysts. “However, a mix of CBRS spectrum could also emerge as an important asset that Dish can integrate
                            into a service offering that appeals to a diverse set of data-centric tech companies,” they wrote.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">They added that it wasn’t long ago that the “anti-Dish crowd" was questioning the company’s ability to fund the $1.4 billion purchase of Boost and a pending $1.1 billion debt maturity. "Dish settled both with its cash on hand,
                            continued to generate free cash flow, and just went out and committed $900 million to buy more spectrum," Piecyk and Galone wrote. "At this point, Verizon should be wondering what Dish might have lined up for the C-Band auction.
                            We are too.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Given the way the CBRS band is structured – and&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/dish-reluctantly-extends-its-600-mhz-spectrum-loan-to-t-mobile">other bands</a></b>, for that matter – it would be possible
                            for Dish to lease spectrum until it needs to use it.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">In Kings County, New York, for example, Verizon won four, Dish won two licenses and Charter Communications won one license, and “those guys are going to use it in some way,” Goemmer said. Still, someone could lease spectrum from
                            Dish and make the capital outlay knowing they could use the GAA spectrum if they need to, but “I think the question would be if you’re willing to fall back and use GAA, if you lose the lease, why wouldn’t you just operate in
                            GAA all the time?,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anything that really stands out to me right now that there’s a clear second-hand market.”</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 500;">The quiet period for the PAL auction runs through September 17.</p>

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Marek’s Take: Private networks, fixed wireless are winners in CBRS auction</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 8, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Sue Marek </span>
                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">Dish Network, Verizon Communications and cable companies such as Comcast, Charter and Cox Communications grabbed the headlines last week when the FCC announced the winning bidders in the recent auction of the Citizens Broadband Radio
                        Services (<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/what-cbrs">CBRS</a>) 3.5 GHz spectrum.
                        <div id="content-embed-one-wrapper">
                            <div id="content-embed-one">But I think the more compelling story to tell about the CBRS auction is what the smaller, non-traditional players that won just a few spectrum licenses in rural America might do with their licenses.</div>
                        </div> One of the big selling points of the CBRS auction was that it would enable new market entrants and smaller and rural operators to build networks at very attractive costs. If there’s any question as to whether this auction accomplished
                        that goal, just take a look at the variety of companies that are among the winning bidders. For example, Alyrica Networks, an internet service provider in Oregon’s mid-Willamette Valley, won 19 licenses and paid $1.36 million.
                        Oil and gas firm Chevron USA purchased 26 licenses and paid $1.06 million. Deere &amp; Company, the tractor manufacturing and technology company, purchased five licenses for $545,999. And LocaLoop Inc., which describes itself as
                        a provider of rural 5G fixed wireless service in Minnesota, paid $5.8 million for 113 licenses. Companies like Chevron and Deere &amp; Company are expected to use their CBRS spectrum to build private LTE networks. Alex Besen, founder
                        of the Besen Group, a consultancy group that has studied how different companies will use CBRS spectrum, predicts the industry will see many new business models develop as companies deploy private LTE networks using these licenses.
                        “I think that we will see oil and gas companies start by deploying a private LTE network and then migrate to 5G when the time is appropriate,” Besen said. He added that each Priority Access License (PAL) is for a 10 MHz channel
                        in the 3.5 GHz to 3.6 GHz band, which is enough to deploy 5G, especially for a private network. How will these companies use their private LTE networks?&nbsp;It will probably vary depending upon the industry. For example, Deere
                        &amp; Company has indicated interest in providing high-speed connectivity for its manufacturing facilities and also for some of its customers. One possible scenario is that the company bundles connectivity with their equipment,
                        similar to how computer manufacturers bundled their laptops with LTE several years ago. And utility companies such as Alabama Power Company, which paid $18.9 million for 103 licenses, will likely build private LTE networks to support
                        the electrical grid and provide IoT applications.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/private-wireless/ameren-shares-private-lte-network-details">Power companies have already been experimenting with private LTE networks in other spectrum bands.</a>&nbsp;For
                        example, Nokia recently announced that Ameren, which provides electricity to 2.4 million customers and natural gas to more than 900,000 customers, is trialing Nokia’s private LTE technology in the 900 MHz spectrum band in Missouri
                        and Illinois for 14 different use cases, including security systems and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). Another potential business model may come from real estate companies. JBG Smith, a Washington, D.C., real
                        estate investment firm, paid $25 million for seven CBRS licenses in the Washington, D.C./Arlington, Virginia area. Besen speculated that JBG may want to use its licenses to build a private LTE network and offer coverage and access
                        to the network to its portfolio of buildings and real estate developments. This particular business model could be particularly disruptive to wireless operators and broadband companies because if real estate firms, small cities,
                        or even homeowners associations start offering wireless broadband services to their members, they could effectively cut the carriers out of the loop. Rural operators and WISPs, meanwhile, will have a very different agenda for using
                        their CBRS licenses. Many WISPs have already been deploying LTE in the CBRS spectrum using the unlicensed portion of the band. However, by using licensed spectrum they don’t have to worry about interference or sharing the band
                        with any incumbent users.&nbsp;WISPs, which often provide wireless internet to underserved communities using WiFi in unlicensed spectrum, will benefit from deploying LTE in the CBRS band because it will provide them with a much
                        larger potential customer base. LTE in the CBRS band offers better propagation than other bands so signals can travel much farther and also penetrate buildings. Rural wireless operators, meanwhile, have a similar advantage because
                        they can achieve better performance using the CBRS mid-band spectrum and with PAL licenses they don’t have to worry about sharing the band with any incumbent users. Also, using licensed spectrum means that some players could potentially
                        generate roaming revenue from bigger operators such as Verizon. Since Verizon purchased numerous CBRS licenses, the operator will likely be incorporating support for the CBRS band in more of its handsets in the future. These new
                        CBRS licensees hold the potential to disrupt and grow the wireless market, which is exciting for the whole industry. But like other market disruptors, it’s possible that not all these new business models will survive or thrive.
                        Nevertheless, it’s exciting to think about the possibilities.</div> Sue Marek

                        (PAL) auction, an important milestone toward reaching the full potential of the spectrum sharing model, further demonstrated the growing market demand for OnGo deployments. On September 16, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission

                        Over the past 12 months, tens of thousands of CBRS devices were deployed to satisfy an impressive range of indoor and outdoor use cases, including mobile broadband, fixed wireless access, and enterprise private LTE networks. As
                        of Sept. 1, 2020, there are over 100 FCC-authorized end-user devices and over 35 OnGo certified devices. CBRS Alliance membership nearly quadrupled since the inaugural meeting in April 2017 and now includes more than 175 active
                        member companies who recognize the value that shared spectrum technology brings to enterprises and consumers alike. Increasingly, membership not only includes network operators, WISPs, device manufacturers, and other solution providers,
                        but also end user organizations, such as the University of New Mexico, further showcasing the breadth and depth of the ever-growing OnGo ecosystem. The recently-completed PAL auction generated over $4.5 billion with the&nbsp;

                    <h2 class="title yellowText-800 pt-4">Nextlink to launch fixed wireless with Google, Nokia in CBRS winnings</h2>
                    <span class="news_date opaqueText-38">September 18, 2020</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span></span>
                    <div class="body card-text opaqueText-54">HUDSON OAKS, Texas – Nextlink Internet was one of the top investors in the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) recent auction of "CBRS" airwaves licenses, which will enable the company to more effectively deliver high-speed broadband
                        and voice services to more subscribers in small towns and rural areas of 11 U.S. states: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. The FCC announced the Citizen's Band
                        Radio Service (CBRS) auction results on September 2, and a legal "quiet period" expired on September 17. AMG Technology Investment Group, LLC, which does business as Nextlink Internet, invested $28.4 million to win a total of 1,072
                        Priority Access Licenses (PALs) covering 491 counties in 11 states. AMG was ranked third in the number of licenses won; third in the number of markets covered; and ninth in invested capital. With access to these licensed airwaves,
                        the company will be able to reach over 14 million people across rural America. "Nextlink Internet is striving to become the top internet service provider in small towns and rural markets across the Central USA, and the licenses
                        we've just won will enable us to reach more customers with advanced, interference-free broadband services," said Bill Baker, CEO of Nextlink Internet. Following a regulatory process that lasted more than five years, the FCC recently
                        opened access to the Citizens Broadband Radio Service spectrum band (CBRS, 3550-3700 MHz), a previously under-utilized swath of airwaves that are well-suited for delivering high-speed internet services via fixed-wireless network
                        technology. Ted Osborn, Nextlink Internet's SVP of Strategy &amp; Regulatory Affairs, applauded the FCC for the ground-breaking approach it took in the CBRS matter, which resulted in a record number of diverse auction bidders,
                        many of them serving small communities like Nextlink. "This is truly the 'Innovation Band,' and we look forward to fulfilling the commissions' goal of expanding internet access in under-served areas," Osborn said. Nextlink is already
                        working with two major players in the tech and telecom industry to expand and upgrade its networks using the CBRS airwaves. Google is providing both its Spectrum Access System (SAS) to deliver maximum spectrum availability, and
                        its browser-based Network Planner, to increase the efficiency of network operations; and Nokia is providing advanced Long-Term Evolution (LTE) hardware solutions. Preston Marshall, Engineering Director at Google and Chairman of
                        the CBRS Alliance, said, "Google has supported CBRS and spectrum sharing alongside other industry leaders for years, and we're delighted to work with Nextlink, an innovative and capable operator, as they put CBRS spectrum to use
                        across America's heartland." John Harrington, SVP, U.S. Major Accounts at Nokia, said, "In addition to making the right technology choices, the right spectrum strategy is critical for service providers to deliver high-speed internet
                        to underserved communities. Nextlink has put the right pieces in place, and we applaud its commitment to expanding its footprint with CBRS. Our partnership with Nextlink and our expertise in deploying LTE-based solutions in shared
                        spectrum will give more people and businesses access to telehealth, remote learning, expanded sales presence, and more."</div>
